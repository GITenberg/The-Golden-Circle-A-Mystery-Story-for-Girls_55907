<br />HER LUCKY DAY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Friday, the thirteenth! This is my
luck-e-e day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne half sang these words as she
sat bolt upright in bed and switched on the
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be entirely out of luck if you don&rsquo;t
lie right down and go to sleep!&rdquo; Florence
Huyler, her pal, exclaimed, making a significant
gesture toward a sofa pillow which, as
the little French girl had reason to know, was
both heavy and hard. And Florence had muscle.
Of late she had been developing herself.
She had gone back to her old work as physical
director in one of the many gymnasiums of
this great city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; the slim girl protested. &ldquo;It is
morning. I am awake. Who wants to sleep
after waking up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look at the clock! Such an hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne looked. Then her small mouth
formed a perfect circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yet I am awake!&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t hurt me,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;you
with your hundred and sixty pounds, and poor
me, just a little bit of nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, Florence would not harm her little
French friend. She adored her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; The exquisite little dancer tossed
her blonde head, danced out of bed, flipped
out one light, flipped on another, and then continued,
&ldquo;I shall be away in one little minute.
This is my luckee day. I must go to dance
the sun up from the lake where he has been
sleeping, the lazee fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence turned her face to the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no resisting her,&rdquo; she whispered
to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet many have been resisting her,&rdquo;
she thought sorrowfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>This was true. All that is life&mdash;each joy, every
sorrow&mdash;must come to an end. The run
of the gypsy drama in which Jeanne had
played so important a role had ended in June.
At first they had believed it would be easy to
secure a booking for the coming season. It
was not easy. Jeanne&rsquo;s talents were limited.
No dramatic production of any sort was being
prepared for the coming year which had a part
she could play. They had gone from booking
house to booking house, from manager to manager.
All had returned Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s smile,
but none had offered her a contract.</p>
<p>All this had not discouraged the little
French girl in the least. She believed in what
she called her &ldquo;luck.&rdquo; Fortunate child! Who
can fail if he but believes hard enough and
long enough in his luck?</p>
<p>So, though the booking season was all but
at an end and prospects were as dark as a
December dawn, Jeanne was keeping up her
training. Just now, two hours before dawn,
she was preparing to go to the park and dance
the dew off the grass while the sun came
creeping up from the waters of Lake Michigan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>As Jeanne peered into the closet a spot of
flaming red smote her eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My luckee dress!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;And
this is my luckee day! Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further ado, she robed herself in a
dress of flaming red which was as short as a
circus rider&rsquo;s costume and decorated with so
many ruffles that it was impossible to tell
where dress ended and ruffles began.</p>
<p>After tying a broad sash of darker red about
her waist, she slipped on socks that rose
scarcely above her shoetops, kicked on some
pumps, switched out the light and tripped
down the stairs to step out into the dewy night.</p>
<p>There are those who are thrilled as they
prowl about a city in the dead of night. Others
are fascinated by the white lights that
gleam before midnight. As for Petite Jeanne,
she preferred the hour before dawn, when all
the world is asleep. Then, like some wood
nymph, she might haunt the dew-drenched
park and dance to her heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>But now, as she left her home at the edge
of the park to go skipping down the deserted
street, a strange feeling stole over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the dress,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>And so it was. She had worn that dress,
no, not in America at all. And yet she had
called it her lucky dress.</p>
<p>It had been in France. Ah yes, in France,
her beloved France! That was where it had
brought her good fortune. There, as a girl in
her early teens, she had traveled with the Gypsies
and danced with her pet bear. When she
danced in this flaming gown, spinning round
and round until the ruffles seemed a gay windmill
wheel, how the coins had come thumping
in around her tiny feet!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now I am fourteen no more,&rdquo; she
sighed. &ldquo;And yet, perhaps it is a lucky dress
for Petite Jeanne, even now. Who can tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke these words half aloud, she
cast a furtive glance down a dark alley. Instantly
her mood changed. On her face came
a look of horror. Her lithe limbs trembled.
She seemed about to fall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>She did not fall. Instead, summoning all
her courage, she went bounding down the
street.</p>
<p>What had happened? She had seen a face,
a gypsy face. It was an evil face, and one she
had seen before. But not in America. In
France.</p>
<p>She had read the look in those burning eyes.
The man had seen the dress before. He could
not but know the one who wore it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he is bad! Bad!&rdquo; she panted.</p>
<p>One quick glance back, and she doubled her
pace. The man was coming. He was gaining.</p>
<p>What had she to fear from him? What had
she not? Was he not the leader of a gypsy clan
who bore a deadly hate for every member of
the Bihari Tribe? And had she not traveled
for many months with the Bihari?</p>
<p>She rounded a corner. Before her stood an
open basement window. &ldquo;Any port in a
storm.&rdquo; With a sprightly spring she cleared
the window sill and disappeared.</p>
<p>And then&mdash;confusion! Where was she?
What had happened?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />FROM OUT THE WRECKAGE</h2>
<p>When she thrust a foot through the
open window, Jeanne felt some solid
object beneath her and was thankful. But
scarcely had she thrown the full weight of
her body on that object and swung herself
through than the thing beneath her veered to
the right, swayed for a second, and then gave
way and went down with a terrifying crash.</p>
<p>And Petite Jeanne, when she had regained
her scattered senses, found herself in the midst
of it all. What was worse, it appeared to be
a total wreck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;where am I? What have I done?&rdquo;
she moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, I escaped him,&rdquo; she philosophized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>But was she better off? Having had a full
moment to reflect there in the darkness and
silence, she began to doubt it. Here she was
in a strange place&mdash;some one&rsquo;s basement, and
all about her was darkness. That she had done
some damage was certain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;is my luckee day. And
what a start!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to get going.&rdquo; She made an attempt
to free herself from the entangled mass into
which she had fallen. She put out a hand and
felt the rough edge of splintered wood. She
moved a foot, and a fragment of glass crashed
to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place is a wreck!&rdquo; she all but sobbed.
&ldquo;And I did it. Or did I? How could I do so
much?&rdquo; She began to doubt her senses.</p>
<p>Now she sat up, silent, intent. Her ears had
caught the sound of footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one&rsquo;s coming. Now I&rsquo;m in for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The footsteps seemed to fall as lightly as a
fairy&rsquo;s toes. Scarcely had Petite Jeanne begun
to wonder about that when there came
the sound of a door being opened. Next instant
a light flashed on, revealing in the doorway
the face of a girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>And such a girl! Jeanne pronounced her
Irish without a second&rsquo;s hesitation. She had
those unmistakable smiling Irish eyes. And
they were smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s younger than I am, and no larger,
though her shoulders are broader. She&rsquo;s bony.
Maybe she works too hard and eats too little.&rdquo;
These thoughts, flashing through the little
French girl&rsquo;s keen mind for the moment, drove
all thought of her plight out of her head. For
those eyes, those smiling Irish eyes, were the
sort that take hearts captive. Petite Jeanne
was a willing captive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you fall in the window?&rdquo; the girl
asked.</p>
<p>Jeanne did not answer. She began to stare
in amazement at the wreckage all about her.
Metal lamps with broken shades, tables split
across the top, chairs with rounds gone&mdash;all
these and many more articles of furniture and
equipment were there, and all broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t believe, unless I saw it,&rdquo; she
said gravely, &ldquo;that so much damage could be
done with one tumble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo; The girl laughed merrily.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our junk pile. It will all be fixed some
time. That&rsquo;s what my brother Tad does all
the time. We buy broken things at auction
sales and such places, and he fixes them. Then
we sell them. Tad&rsquo;s older than I am, and an
awfully good fixer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d have to be,&rdquo; said Jeanne, looking at
the wreckage. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think this was the hold
of a vessel after a terrific storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so difficult to fix &rsquo;em. I help sometimes,&rdquo;
the girl said in a quiet tone. &ldquo;But most
of the time I&rsquo;m either out buying, or else in
the shop selling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Buying this.&rdquo; The strange girl made
a sweeping gesture with her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you&mdash;how do you say
that in English? Don&rsquo;t you get stung?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sometimes.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s fine white
teeth showed in a smile. &ldquo;But not often.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let me help you out of there!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
She put out a hand. Jeanne took it.
A fine, hard, capable little hand it was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Jeanne, as she felt her feet once
more on a solid floor, &ldquo;is my luckee day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; agreed the girl. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder
you weren&rsquo;t cut by broken glass. But
how did you happen to come in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gypsy chased me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gypsy! How I hate them!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s
face darkened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t. Not all of them. Some are
good, some bad. I used to be a gypsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really!&rdquo; The big blue eyes were open
wide, staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, in France I traveled with
them for a long, long time. And they were
very, very kind to me, Bihari and his band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that man!&rdquo; She threw an apprehensive
glance toward the open window. &ldquo;Ugh! He
is a very terrible man. I have not seen him in
America before. I wish he would go away forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good he didn&rsquo;t follow you.&rdquo; The girl
glanced once more at the window. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
have been much protection. And Tad, he&mdash;&rdquo;
she hesitated. &ldquo;Well, he isn&rsquo;t much of a
fighter.&rdquo; Jeanne saw a wistful look steal over
the girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;But come!&rdquo; said the impromptu hostess,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here. That gypsy might find
us yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the room and entered a narrow
hallway. Through a door to the right Jeanne
caught the yellow gleam of a fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tad keeps the furnace,&rdquo; the girl said simply.
&ldquo;We get our flat for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a suggestion of pride in her tone
as she said &ldquo;our flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to like her more and more,&rdquo;
thought Jeanne. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merry Murphy.&rdquo; The other girl spelled
the first name out. &ldquo;I have to do it,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;People think it&rsquo;s M-a-r-y.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be M-e-r-r-y,&rdquo; laughed Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our dining room and workshop.&rdquo;
The girl led the way into a room lighted by
a score of lamps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How odd!&rdquo; The words escaped Jeanne&rsquo;s
lips unbidden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all fixed. Tad fixed them,&rdquo; said
Merry proudly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sell them, but until we
do we&rsquo;ll use them. See, the lights are very
tiny. It costs little to use them. And it makes
us forget this is a basement. And it is, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s tone was sincere. &ldquo;I truly
had forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes swept the room and came to
rest on the bent shoulders of a person working
over a small bench in the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tad!&rdquo; Merry called. &ldquo;See what I found in
our storeroom. And see! She isn&rsquo;t broken one
bit.&rdquo; She put an arm about Jeanne&rsquo;s waist and
laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes I am!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed. &ldquo;Broke
flat as a flounder! Is that not how you say it
here in America, when you have not a penny
left?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this,&rdquo; she added quickly, &ldquo;this is my
luckee day. To-day I shall make a beginning
at piling up a fortune. See! I will go out to
dance the sun up out of the lake where he has
been sleeping!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>She sprang across the room in a wild fantastic
whirl which set all the lamps jingling
and twinkling.</p>
<p>Tad threw down his tools and sprang to his
feet. Then the little French girl&rsquo;s dance came
to a sudden end, for she was seized with a
mood that unfitted her for the dance. When
Tad stood up he was no taller than when he
sat down; and yet he was a man in years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; He laughed a strange,
hoarse laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been this way;
just a little tad of a man. You&rsquo;ll get used to
it. I have. So has Merry, here.&rdquo; He laid an
affectionate hand on Merry&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Merry beamed down at him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not how
tall you are, but what you&rsquo;ve got in your head,&rdquo;
she laughed. &ldquo;Tad&rsquo;s head is all full of bright
ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have coffee very soon.
Won&rsquo;t you stay and have some with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then who will dance the sun up from
the lake?&rdquo; Jeanne went dancing away again.
&ldquo;Oh, no I must not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I must come back. Truly I must. You
will take me to a sale, a very strange sale.
Will you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This very morning! How wonderful!
And this is my luckee day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the door, if you must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly I must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merry led the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; said Jeanne as she stood at
the foot of the stairway leading to the street.
&ldquo;If I go to this sale shall I buy something, a
very small package all sealed up, very mysterious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes, I think you may.&rdquo; The Irish girl
laughed a merry Irish laugh. &ldquo;At this sale all
packages are sealed. You don&rsquo;t know what
you buy. You really do not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment Jeanne found herself tripping
lightly over the dewy grass, bound for
the spot beneath the willows where on many
a morning before the world was awake, she
had gone through her fairy-like dances undisturbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />THE MAGIC UMBRELLA</h2>
<p>The sun was still sleeping peacefully beneath
the lake when she arrived at the
grove of broad, spreading willows. Off to the
east huge clouds like ghosts in dark robes
were rushing over the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind,&rdquo; laughed Petite Jeanne,
&ldquo;I know you. You are only a great big bluff.
When Mister Sun comes out he will dress you
in pink and gold. After that he will fade you
to palest pale and send you scampering away
to cast thin shadows over meadows and pastures
where lambs are feeding on clover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if the thought of gamboling lambs set
her limbs in motion, the little French girl went
springing away in a sprightly dance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>For a full quarter of an hour she lost herself
in the intoxicating joy of action. Now she
raced away before a breeze. Now she whirled
until all her red petticoats were wheels. Now
she threw her head back and laughed at the
birds who scolded from the trees. And now,
snatching the sash from her waist, she went
bowing and weaving away toward the sandy
beach where little white waves were playing.</p>
<p>It was while on her way back from this little
journey that she sought a lone bench beneath
the greatest of the willows for a moment of
rest.</p>
<p>It was that time of half-light just before
dawn. Already the fearsome clouds were beginning
to lose their terror. They had taken
on a faint touch of old rose.</p>
<p>Jeanne dropped down upon the bench, as
she had done many times before, without looking.
The next instant she gave forth a startled
little &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man was seated beside her. Quite an old
man he was, with long gray hair protruding
from an ancient slouch hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are human!&rdquo; His drawl was soft,
melodious. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t believe you could be. Only
fairies dance like that. I thought you a fairy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>As if to assure himself that he could not be
mistaken, he touched the hem of her broad,
short skirt.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne wanted to spring up and run
away. No one had ever been here at this hour;
yet something held her in her place.</p>
<p>There are times in all our lives when it
seems that an invisible hand, resting upon our
shoulder, bids us stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;why there were times when you
flew,&rdquo; the melodious voice went on. &ldquo;Flew!
That&rsquo;s what you did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I flew once.&rdquo; His voice took on a reminiscent
air. &ldquo;In an airplane, I mean. Often
thought I&rsquo;d try it again. But when you have
a narrow escape once&mdash;&rdquo; The voice trailed
off. For a moment there was silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he began once more, &ldquo;a fellow
asked me to go up. I said it might rain; I&rsquo;d
go if I could take my umbrella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked at my umbrella, and said: &lsquo;You
can&rsquo;t take that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most men hate umbrellas. Rather get wet
than carry one. Guess he was that way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I said: &lsquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll go up.&rsquo; So we
went up. And I took my umbrella; slipped it
in, kind o&rsquo; hid it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, by and by, when we were up a long
way and the houses took to looking small, he
saw that umbrella. Then he was hopping mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said: &lsquo;You got to throw that out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t, mister. It would get lost.
It belongs to my grandfather. It&rsquo;s silk. The
silk came from China where little yellow ladies
wound it off silk cocoons by hand. And the
bows are all steel, forged by hand. And besides,
it might hit somebody and mighty nigh
kill &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t matter. Out she goes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I says: &lsquo;If she goes out, I go with
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s jake with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So up I climbs and out I jumps. And fall!
You never saw the houses get big as fast as
those did!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;I got to thinking I might fall on somebody
and was feelin&rsquo; mighty sorry about that, when
I thought of my umbrella. All silk from China
it was, where little yeller women wound it out
from cocoons. And the bows all made from
hand forged steel. Strong they were, strong as
London Bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I thought of my umbrella I
knew it was all right; parachute, don&rsquo;t you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more his voice trailed away like the
last echo of a distant tolling bell.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne stole a look at his face. It was
still, and almost beautiful. &ldquo;Like a child&rsquo;s
dream,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo; He came to himself with a
start. &ldquo;Then I opened up that umbrella. Silk,
you understand, all pure silk, and bows of
forged steel. Strong as London Bridge. I
opened her up, and she caught me and held
me and let me down in a cabbage patch. Now
what do you think of that?&rdquo; His face was all
wreathed with smiles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do I think?&rdquo; said Petite Jeanne, with
a shy smile in return for his. The light in her
eyes was kindly, and the touch on his arm
gentle, for the little French girl loved old men
with long gray hair, and she was charmed by
their stories as she was charmed when she was
six. &ldquo;What do I think? I think you have no
umbrella at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No umbrella!&rdquo; He put out a hand as if to
grasp one. Then, springing to his feet, he pretended
to search the bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Some one has stolen
it! My grandfather&rsquo;s umbrella. And such a
fine umbrella, all silk from China. Little yeller
women&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. You told me,&rdquo; laughed Petite
Jeanne. &ldquo;But see! The sun is smiling on the
water! I must dance him out for a new day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; she sang as she danced away,
&ldquo;this is my luckee day!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />SIX FEROCIOUS BEARS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Jeanne, as she returned
from dancing the sun up, &ldquo;tell me another
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the old man looked at her a droll smile
played over his wrinkled face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
you believe my stories,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I do!&rdquo; she protested vigorously.
&ldquo;At&mdash;at least, almost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then&mdash;&rdquo; He placed his feet on the
ground, then prodded the sod with his cane.
&ldquo;Once I was in the Catskill Mountains&mdash;or
was it the Cascades? I disremember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mountains don&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; the girl
laughed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ever remember names. But
mountains. There are always bears in mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The little French girl&rsquo;s look suddenly went
very sober. She seemed ready to burst into
tears. Little wonder, for only one short month
before she had buried her pet and pal, Tico the
bear. Tico had shared her joys and sorrows
for many a year. With him as her dancing
partner, she had achieved notable success.
Now he was gone. So, too, it seemed, were
her chances of ever dancing on the stage again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; she thought with a sigh, &ldquo;My
pal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tico&rsquo;s illness had cost her much money. He
had been given all the care of a gentleman of
importance, and had been buried in a formal
manner. Now the little French girl was poor,
and Tico was gone forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bears,&rdquo; she repeated, pulling herself together,
&ldquo;bears in the mountains. Wild bears.
Not tame ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, wild bears!&rdquo; the old man said as if
taking his cue. &ldquo;Six ferocious wild bears. I
met them all in the Alleghenys&mdash;or was it the
Rockies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cumberlands,&rdquo; laughed Jeanne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it, the Cumberlands. Six wild,
hungry, man eating bears. They formed a circle
about me and sat there on their haunches
with their tongues lolling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were ready to eat me. And what did
I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I danced and made faces. I can dance; not
like fairies. But I can dance and make faces.
Want to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne nodded her head.</p>
<p>Springing from his place on the bench, the
old man began to dance.</p>
<p>And now it was the girl&rsquo;s turn to open her
eyes wide in surprise. This old man was an
artist. True, he did not dance as lightly as she.
But he knew steps and movements. He had
not been on his feet for five minutes when she
realized that he could teach her much about
her own beloved art.</p>
<p>In the joy of dancing he forgot the terrible
faces he was to make.</p>
<p>At last, quite out of breath, he threw himself
down beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been on the stage,&rdquo; she said solemnly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, so I have. All my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put out a small hand. &ldquo;I, too.&rdquo; Her
voice was mellow with emotion. &ldquo;I am Petite
Jeanne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petite Jeanne! I should have guessed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; Jeanne still held his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plain Dan Baker. A ham actor. You never
heard of me. And never will. They won&rsquo;t let
me hoof it in the sticks any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure of that,&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s face was
sober. &ldquo;Once to every man and nation. Your
time may come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the bears?&rdquo; She whirled about. &ldquo;What
of the six ferocious bears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she turned she saw with a start that a
second man, a young man with dark skin and
very black eyes, had dropped to the bench on
the other side of Dan Baker.</p>
<p>Did Dan Baker know this? Was he acquainted
with this young man? If so, he made
no sign but went straight on with his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, the bears!&rdquo; He chuckled. &ldquo;There
they were, six bears, brown bears; no, grizzlies.
There they were ready to eat me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did I do? I began dancing and making
faces. A bear&rsquo;s got a sense of humor; oh,
yes, a very keen sense of humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No time at all till I had &rsquo;em; had &rsquo;em good.
Most appreciative audience you ever saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, still dancing, I began chucking them
hard under their chins, cracking their teeth on
their tongues. See!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No time at all and their tongues were so
sore they couldn&rsquo;t swallow. So why try to eat
me?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way they looked at it. Soon as
the show was over they left; went right off
into the mountains; all but one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that one, the biggest one of all, meant
to eat me, sore tongue or no tongue at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a ferocious growl, tongue out, teeth
shining, he came right at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I do? What could I do? Just
one thing. An inspiration! I sprang at him,
seized his tongue, crammed it down his throat
and choked him to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killed him,&rdquo; said a voice over his shoulder.
It was the strange young man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he bite you?&rdquo; asked Petite Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bite me? Oh, yes, to be sure. But then,
what&rsquo;s a little bite between friends?&rdquo; Once
more that deep, dry chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angelo!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;This is Petite
Jeanne. She dances, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does! I saw her. It was divine!&rdquo; The
youth&rsquo;s eyes shone.</p>
<p>Jeanne flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Dan Baker to Jeanne, &ldquo;Angelo,
here, tries to write plays. I try to be a
ham actor. You try to dance on the stage.
They won&rsquo;t let any one of us do what we wish
to do, so we should get on famously together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all going to be rich,&rdquo; Jeanne said
cheerfully. &ldquo;For this is my luckee day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be rich, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the
young Italian, springing to his feet. &ldquo;This
very moment I have a bright idea. I shall write
a play around you two. You shall act it, and
we&rsquo;ll be made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But come! I still have the price of coffee
and rolls for three. It is time for that now.
Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>

<br />COFFEE FOR THREE</h2>
<p>It was with a critical eye that Petite Jeanne
studied her strange companions as they
marched away across the park toward the
nearest row of shops where a lunch counter
might be found. With her native French caution
she resolved not to be taken in by strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They amuse me,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Especially
the old man. And yet, I wonder if
amuse is just the right word. He tells prodigious
lies. I wonder if he really means you to
believe them. And yet, who would not love
him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cup of coffee on a stool,&rdquo; she concluded.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the harm in that? He may tell me
other stories.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>A cup of coffee on a stool was exactly what
it turned out to be. The young host made no
apologies as he bowed the little French girl to
the nearest lunch counter and gave her his
hand as she mounted the high seat.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne ordered sugar wafers, the others
ordered doughnuts, and they all had coffee.</p>
<p>Dan Baker told no stories over that coffee.
It was Angelo who did the talking until he hit
upon the fact that Jeanne had traveled with
gypsies. Then his big dark eyes lighted with
a strange fire as he demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about that. Tell me all about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne was tempted not to tell. But
the coffee was truly fine, and this was to be
her lucky day. Why begin it by refusing such
a simple request by a friendly young man?</p>
<p>She told her story, told it very well, told of
her wanderings across France in a gypsy van.
Once more she danced with her bear down
country lanes and across village squares. She
sang for pennies at fairs and carnivals. She
haunted the streets of Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful Paris. Marvelous, matchless,
beautiful city of my dreams!&rdquo; Dan Baker murmured,
even as she rambled on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Jeanne loved him for it. For her, Paris
would always remain the most beautiful city
in all the world.</p>
<p>As she told her story the dark eyes of the
Italian youth, Angelo, were ever upon her.
Yet his look was not an offensive one. So impersonal
was it that he might have been looking
at a marble statue. Yet there was a burning
fire in his eyes, the fire of hope, of a new
born dream. In that dream he was laying
plans, plans for her, Petite Jeanne; a play, his
play; a light opera, and what a light opera it
would be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed as she hopped
nimbly off her stool. &ldquo;I have told you my
story. It is a happy little, sad little story, isn&rsquo;t
it? As all true stories must be. There have
been for me many moments of happiness. And
who in all the world can hope for more than
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak the truth, child.&rdquo; Dan Baker
smiled. In that smile there was something so
full of meaning, so suggestive of a kindly soul
grown mellow with time, that Jeanne wished
to stand on tiptoe and kiss that wrinkled face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Instead, she patted his hand and murmured:
&ldquo;Thank you so much for such a lovely time
and for those wonderful, wonderful stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not leaving us so soon?&rdquo; protested
the young Italian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must. This is to be my luckee day.
Strange, mysterious happenings have come to
me. More will come. I have an engagement
to meet a new friend. She will take me to a
sale. There I shall buy a package at auction.
What is in the package? Who knows? Perhaps
I shall purchase two, or even three. What
will these contain? Who knows? Much, I am
sure. For this is my luckee day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sang these last words as she danced out
of the lunch room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>The others followed. &ldquo;But you will see me
again,&rdquo; pleaded the young Italian. &ldquo;You are
to be in my play, my light opera. I shall write
it at once, around you; you only and him, my
white-haired friend. It shall be about your
beautiful Paree. And oh, how wonderful it
shall be! It has all come to me as you told
your story. It is wonderful! Marvelous! I
have only to write it. And I shall write it with
an electric pen that spits fire. You shall see!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only grant me this!&rdquo; In his excitement he
waved his hands wildly. Petite Jeanne could
have loved him for that; for is it not thus they
do in her beloved France? &ldquo;Grant me this!&rdquo;
he pleaded. &ldquo;Come to my studio to-night.
When your lucky day is over. Then the night
shall be more fortunate than the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; he exclaimed as he read doubt in
her eyes. &ldquo;It is all right. My white-haired
friend will be there. And if you wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the girl impulsively, &ldquo;I will
come. I will bring my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he agreed eagerly. &ldquo;Bring your
friends. Bring many friends. We shall have a
party by the open fire. We shall have tea and
biscuits and preserves from my native land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the little French girl, as a teasing
smile played about her lips. &ldquo;I will bring one
friend, only one. And she is big as a policeman,
and so strong! Mon Dieu! She is a physical
director. She can swim a mile, and skate
like a man. And, oh, la, la! You shall see her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>At that she went dancing away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was teasing you,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s a marvel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She is all that. And you will write a
play for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will write one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where shall we open? In Peoria?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peoria? Chicago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have never played in a great city. I
am a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this life,&rdquo; the youth broke in, &ldquo;it is not
what you have been that counts. It is what
you are going to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In three months you will see your name beside
that other one, Petite Jeanne, and men
will fight at the box office for tickets. You
shall see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man said no more. But as they
walked away, he squared his bent shoulders
and took on for a time quite a military air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />THE PLACE OF CHANCE</h2>
<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock that morning Jeanne
found herself seated beside the blue-eyed,
laughing Merry in the front row of
chairs of a big, bare salesroom. Before them
was a long, high platform. Back of the platform,
piled to the ceiling, was an odd assortment
of boxes, bales, bags, trunks and bundles,
the week&rsquo;s accumulation of articles lost or rejected
in the offices of a great express company.</p>
<p>The place was half filled when they arrived.
All the front seats were taken save two. From
these, hats mysteriously disappeared as Merry
approached. She nodded Jeanne to one chair
and chose another for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men saved seats for us,&rdquo; Jeanne
whispered in surprise. &ldquo;Do ladies always get
front seats?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; Merry shook her head vigorously.
&ldquo;Ladies are no good. They bid too high. After
that they make a fuss because they&rsquo;ve robbed
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no lady! Me?&rdquo; The Irish girl drew
herself up proudly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a buyer. They all
know me, these men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Weston!&rdquo; She had turned to the
man at her left. &ldquo;This is Petite Jeanne. She&rsquo;s
going to buy, just one lot. You&rsquo;ll lay off,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she belong to the union?&rdquo; The ruddy-faced
German grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Merry laughed back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll lay off, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; He
turned to the man at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; The one who spoke seemed as
much out of place there as did Petite Jeanne.
He was young and, in a way, handsome. His
features were regular, his forehead high. But
about his eyes was a look of dissatisfaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;His life is a story, an interesting story,&rdquo;
Jeanne told herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to read it.&rdquo; To
this little French girl the world was a stage
indeed, and all men actors. She was to learn
more of the ways of those who haunt auction
sales ere the day was done.</p>
<p>Had some great artist come upon that
scene, he would surely have hidden himself
away behind boxes and bundles, to peer
through some narrow crack and prepare a
hasty sketch which must in time be developed
into an immortal work of art. There they
were, Jeanne and Merry, like two beings from
another world; two glowing spots of color,
one orange, one bright purple, against a dull
tide of brown, gray and black. The scene
about them was grim and sordid. It spoke of
the cluttered stalls of Maxwell Street where
the poor of the city quarrel over the rags that
must serve them in lieu of garments, and of
grim, stark tenements where men struggle in
vain for warmth and bread.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>There were deep lines in the faces of those
who ranged themselves, tier on tier, behind the
girls, waiting patiently for the show, which
was a weekly auction, to begin. And yet there
was to be seen in many a pair of eyes a glint
of pleasurable anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at them,&rdquo; Merry whispered, allowing
her glance to sweep the growing throng.
&ldquo;They are gamblers; gamblers all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gamblers!&rdquo; Jeanne voiced her astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are. You shall see. And this is a
gambling institution. The auctioneer will tell
them they are gambling. Perhaps you will
hear him say it. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not what you can make,
but what you stand to lose.&rsquo; He says that.
And yet they bid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will hear them very soon, bidding six
dollars, seven, eight for three packages.
What&rsquo;s in the packages? They are wrapped
tight. Not one of them can know. They bet
their money that the packages will increase
their meager pile of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very seldom. Oh, yes, sometimes there
are fine new goods, silk stockings, dresses,
shoes. They can&rsquo;t all be bad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;But then, too, you may pay real money for
a worthless bundle of rags or a handful of
broken dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; she added with a sigh, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
the call of the gambler that brings them here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; said Jeanne, &ldquo;do you also gamble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very seldom. I buy only what I can see.
To-day there are lamps, good ones, and not
badly broken. I shall buy them. I can see two
new traveling bags. If they are empty they
will sell for very little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if they are full&mdash;&rdquo; She threw back her
shoulders and smiled. &ldquo;Then you shall see
how they will bid. For in their dreams they
see in those bags, lost in the express by other
people, a fortune in watches, diamonds and
silks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will they find? A few moth eaten
garments, some old letters, a book or two, and
some worthless trinkets. Did you ever pack
your treasures in a traveling bag? Never.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when men are poor&mdash;&rdquo; She sighed
again. &ldquo;They will gamble, for they have little
to lose and always dream of gaining much.
And after all, what is life without dreams?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dreams! Ah, yes!&rdquo; Jeanne answered.
&ldquo;And shall we not gamble a wee bit to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a wee bit.&rdquo; Merry squeezed her hand.
&ldquo;One small package for you and one for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, let&rsquo;s do!&rdquo; the little French girl
whispered eagerly, &ldquo;For this is my luckee
day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />THE MARBLE FALCON</h2>
<p>The auctioneer, a large, bald man with
a warming smile, climbed to the platform
and announced the terms of the sale.
&ldquo;Goods,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;are sold as is. No
complaints will be listened to. A deposit will
be required with each purchase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ja! We know,&rdquo; jeered one future purchaser.
&ldquo;If ve get hooked ve don&rsquo;t kick. You
get our money. It iss good money. So you
don&rsquo;t kick. All iss sveet and lovely. Ja!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd laughed. The auctioneer laughed
with them. And well he could afford to, for it
was he who always had the last laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; Weston, the ruddy-cheeked
German, whispered in Merry&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;seventy-five
is union price.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo; Merry turned her smiling
eyes upon his. Those eyes had done much for
her in the past. If she particularly wished a
package, these, her friends of the &ldquo;union,&rdquo; refused
to bid, and she bought it at her own
price. The &ldquo;union&rdquo; was a union only in name.
It was composed of a group of regular buyers
who, meeting here and elsewhere, had themselves
united in a bond of friendship.</p>
<p>This day, however, the union found itself
greatly outnumbered by casual customers who
on occasion bid high, and returned home later
to curse the spirit of chance that for the moment
had held them under its spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three packages!&rdquo; shouted the auctioneer.
&ldquo;Three! How much apiece? How much for
each one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who goes seventy-five?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; exclaimed Merry. &ldquo;Watch them
climb! Seventy-five is union price. How can
we buy to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I still have money,&rdquo; insisted
Jeanne. &ldquo;We must buy. I will pay. This is
my luckee day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no luck if you break union rules.
Wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did wait. Half an hour, an hour, an
hour and a half the sale went on. Merry
bought two damaged lamps and a broken
chair. These went for a song. But packages!
How they soared!</p>
<p>Merry took to bidding union price at the
very start. &ldquo;Seventy-five!&rdquo; she shouted again
and again, but each time the throng behind
went far above her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pipe down!&rdquo; Weston shouted back at them.
&ldquo;Give the little girl a chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a chance did they give her.</p>
<p>So the day wore on. The pile behind the
counter had dwindled very low when two
modest sized packages, one with a foreign
label on it, were put up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; hissed Jeanne in sudden excitement.
&ldquo;That one came from France. There are
French words on the label. We must have it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sh! Be still!&rdquo; Merry squeezed her hand.</p>
<p>Weston bid a quarter. Fisheim, a second
member of the union, went to half a dollar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-five!&rdquo; screamed Merry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-five, and sold!&rdquo; shouted the auctioneer.</p>
<p>Merry thanked him with her laughing Irish
eyes. She understood it all. She had been
saving him breath by bidding high at the
start. Now she was repaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Di&mdash;did we get them?&rdquo; the little French
girl demanded breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did. And now we go to the window.
We must pay there. The sale will be over in
ten minutes. Ten more, and we&rsquo;ll march away
with our precious parcels from the big grab-bag.
Tad will come for the lamps and the
chair to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s heavy.&rdquo; Jeanne gave a little skip
of joy as they entered the elevator twenty
minutes later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo; Merry&rsquo;s tone did not echo her
companion&rsquo;s enthusiasm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect too
much, you know. Blessed is he who expecteth
nothing, for he shall not be disappointed!
That&rsquo;s not in the Bible, but it should have
been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your package may be full of old books and
mine loaded with bricks. Old books come
often enough, and I&rsquo;ve seen broken bricks in
a package, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bricks!&rdquo; Jeanne voiced her amazement.
&ldquo;Why would anyone send broken bricks by
express?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t. But, you see, these packages
are sent in from express offices everywhere.
Not all of the agents are honest. If
an agent is about to send in a nice mantel
clock, slightly damaged, what&rsquo;s to hinder his
taking it out and replacing it with broken
bricks? No one will be the wiser. If you or I
buy the package, we get hooked, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bricks!&rdquo; Jeanne said in disgust. &ldquo;But
then, mine is not full of bricks. This is my
luckee day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Merry pulled her into the shadow
of a stairway. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll unwrap them here. No
one will see us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>If Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s hands trembled as she tore
away the paper wrappings with the strange
foreign labels, her whole body trembled and
she appeared about to sink to the ground as
she took one look at that which was within.</p>
<p>She lifted the object half way out of its box,
stared at it with bulging eyes as she murmured
something like &ldquo;Fire God.&rdquo; Then, crowding
the thing back as if it were alive and about
to jump at her, she crammed paper down upon
it and hastily glanced about her to see if any
stranger might have observed her action.
Seeing no one, she heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Merry&rsquo;s tone was joyous. &ldquo;A bird!
A bird carved from marble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a falcon.&rdquo; Jeanne studied it critically.
&ldquo;A marble falcon. And how well it is done!
You know falcons are like eagles and hawks,
only they may be tamed and taught to hunt
for you. There are many of them in Europe
and England. The gypsies are very fond of
them. Gypsies are not allowed to hunt in the
forest preserves. But their birds. Oh, la, la!
That is another matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what a pity!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;His
beak is broken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; laughed Merry. &ldquo;What do you expect
for three greasy quarters? If he were
whole, he&rsquo;d be worth a whole double golden
eagle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the beak is here.&rdquo; She began
feeling about in the excelsior wrappings.
&ldquo;Yes, yes, here it is! How very fortunate!
Now we shall see him all together again. Tad
will fix that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not sell him, for all that,&rdquo; she continued
solemnly. &ldquo;He shall be my very own.
See! He is looking toward the clouds. He has
a broken beak, yet he can look skyward. He
shall be my inspiration. When all seems dark;
when our money is spent and no one comes to
our poor little shop to buy, then I shall look at
my marble falcon and say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are brave. Your beak is broken; yet
you look toward the clouds.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderful!&rdquo; Jeanne murmured.
&ldquo;Would that I, too, possessed a marble falcon
with a broken beak.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what did <i>you</i> find?&rdquo; Merry put out a
hand for Jeanne&rsquo;s package.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; The little French girl&rsquo;s cheeks
paled as she drew back! &ldquo;Not here! I will
show you. But please, not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne was strangely silent as they
rattled homeward on an elevated train. Her
actions, too, were strange. The mysterious
package with its question-provoking foreign
labels lay beside her on the seat. Once, as she
appeared to waken from a trance-like state,
she put out a hand to push the package far
from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if it contained some hidden peril,&rdquo;
Merry told herself.</p>
<p>The next moment, as if afraid some one
would take it from her, the little French girl
was holding the package close to her side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>When they had gained the seclusion of her
own small room, all was changed. She became
vastly excited. Throwing off her wraps,
she pulled down the shades, threw on a table
lamp that gave forth a curious red glow; then,
tearing the package open, she drew forth a curious
figure done in some metal that resembled
bronze. A bust it was, the head and
shoulders of a man. And such a man! Such
a long, twisted nose! Such protruding eyes!
Such a leer as overspread his features!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Merry. &ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; Petite Jeanne spoke as
one in a trance.</p>
<p>She set the bronze figure in the light of the
red lamp. There it appeared to take on the
glow of fire, the popping eyes gleaming wickedly.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne did not seem to mind this.
She stood and stared at the thing until a look
of dreamy rapture overspread her face. Then
she spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the gypsy God of Fire. How often
in hidden places, beside hedges and in the
heart of dark forests I have danced before him
the gypsy fire dance, the dance that brings
health and happiness! How often I have
longed to possess him! And now he is mine!
Mine, for I have bought him. Bought him for
three tiny quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my friend!&rdquo; She threw her arms
about the astonished Merry. &ldquo;Truly you are
my friend. See! See what you have brought
me. The gypsy God of Fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Merry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. And perhaps you never will,&rdquo; the little
French girl whispered. &ldquo;It is a very deep
enchantment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she led her friend on tiptoe to the
door and kissed her good-bye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a very strange girl!&rdquo; Merry murmured
as she made her way down the stairs.
&ldquo;And yet I like her. I&mdash;I love her. I truly
do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />THE GYPSY GOD OF FIRE</h2>
<p>It was with a light tread that Petite
Jeanne&rsquo;s nimble feet carried her up the
seven flights of stairs leading to the studio of
a young playwright named Angelo. It appeared
incredible that this young Italian who
tried to write plays and had known no success,
and a white-haired wanderer who had danced
his way from one small city to another across
the country, could accomplish great things in
mending her fortune and in setting her once
more before the gleaming footlights of some
great theatre. Yet so perfect was her faith
in this, her lucky day, that nothing seemed too
much to expect, even from so humble a beginning.
For, you see, Petite Jeanne believed in
miracles, in angels, fairies, goblins, ghosts and
all the rest. She was French. And French
people, you must know, are that way. For
you surely have read how the great Joan of
Arc, as a child, often spent many hours watching
the fairies play beneath her favorite tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a terribly dingy place,&rdquo; Florence
Huyler, her companion and bodyguard,
said in a low tone as they approached the final
landing. &ldquo;This is a fearfully old building and
we are right beneath the eaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was right. They were beneath the
eaves. She was mistaken, too; more mistaken
than she could have guessed. The place they
entered was large, but not dingy. It was far
from that. Besides being an ambitious young
writer, Angelo was an artist. He had taken this
barn-like attic and had created here a small
paradise.</p>
<p>Having attended a sale at which the stage
settings of a defunct play were being sold, he
had bid in at an astonishingly low sum all the
pieces he desired. The result was surprising.
While one end of his attic studio contained the
accustomed desk and chair of a writer, the
other end was equipped as a stage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>And what a charming stage it was! Angelo
was a genius. With a brush and bright colors
he had transformed the dingiest of drops,
wings and stage furniture into a vision of life
and beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; cried Jeanne as she entered the
room. &ldquo;Once more I am on the stage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one wild fling she went floating like
a golden butterfly across the narrow stage.</p>
<p>Catching the spirit of the moment, the aged
actor, who had been sitting in the corner,
sprang to his feet and joined her in an impromptu
dance that was as unique as it was
charming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! Bravo!&rdquo; Angelo shouted, quite
beside himself with joy. &ldquo;That dance alone
would make any play. But there shall be
others. Many others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; exclaimed Petite Jeanne, breaking
in upon his ecstasy to spring into a corner
and return with something in her hand, &ldquo;this
is the gypsy dance to the God of Fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Depositing some object on the floor, she
deftly manipulated the lights and threw a single
yellow gleam upon it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;A gypsy god!&rdquo; Florence murmured. There
was a touch of awe in her voice, as, indeed,
there might well be. This god was endowed
with power to frighten and subdue. There
was about his features something that was at
the same time ugly and fascinating. In the
yellow light he appeared to glow with hidden
fire.</p>
<p>As the little French girl began to weave and
sway through the snake-like motions of the
gypsy fire dance, a silence fell as upon a first
night when the curtain rises on a scene of extraordinary
beauty.</p>
<p>Even in this humble setting the scene was
gripping. Long after the girl had finished the
dance and thrown herself upon the stage floor
to lie there, head resting upon one bent elbow,
as silent as the gypsy god, the hush still hung
over the room.</p>
<p>No one spoke until the quaint words of this
mysterious child of France rose once more like
a tiny wisp of smoke from the center of the
stage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the gypsy Fire God,&rdquo; she chanted.
&ldquo;Years and years ago, many, many centuries
before we were born, strange men and women
with dark and burning eyes danced their fire
dance in his honor, beneath the palm trees of
India.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the God of Fire. Other gods may
come and go, but he must live on forever. He
will not perish. None can destroy him. Fallen
from some planet where fires burn eternal, he
alone holds the secret of fire. Let him perish
and all fire on earth will cease. Matches will
not light. Wood and fire will not burn. The
earth will grow cold, cold, cold!&rdquo; She shuddered.
And those who listened shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very fire at the center of the earth will
burn low and go out. Then the earth will be
covered with ice and snow. All living things
must perish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not be destroyed!&rdquo; She threw her
arms out as if to protect this god of fiery enchantment.</p>
<p>Again there was silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does not believe that.&rdquo; Florence voiced
her skepticism.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Angelo&rsquo;s voice was tense.
&ldquo;And after all, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. The thing is
perfect. Can&rsquo;t you see? It is perfect!&rdquo; He
sprang excitedly to his feet. &ldquo;This shall be
our first scene. The curtain shall rise just here
and about this God of Fire we shall weave our
play. And it shall be called &lsquo;The Gypsy God
of Fire.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />THE SHADOW ON THE WINDOW PANE</h2>
<p>Even as the young Italian spoke, there
came a knock at the door. With a little
cry of fear, Petite Jeanne threw a small Persian
rug over her treasured god; then, as if
prepared to hold her ground against all comers,
she clenched her small fists and turned to
face the door.</p>
<p>Noting this, Angelo approached the door
with silent footsteps, opened it a crack and
demanded in a hoarse whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only I, your friend, Swen,&rdquo; came in a large
round voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swen Swenson! The Swedish night hawk!&rdquo;
Angelo shouted, throwing the door wide and
extending both hands in greeting: &ldquo;Who
could be more welcome at a time like this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;What time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth who asked this question as he entered
was a near giant in stature. His head
was crowned with a shock of yellow hair. His
cheeks were as rosy as a country child&rsquo;s. His
blue eyes were wide and smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; said Angelo with
a flourish, &ldquo;allow me to present the big Swede
who will write the music for our immortal
masterpiece!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; His eyes circled the room.
&ldquo;Perhaps you believe that the Scandinavians
are not musicians. You are mistaken. Only
recall Jenny Lind and Ole Bull and Eduard
Grieg!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here&mdash;&rdquo; He stood on tiptoe to touch
that shock of yellow hair. &ldquo;Here shall rest the
richest crown of all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; grumbled Swen, as a broad
grin belied his assumed ill humor. &ldquo;But if
you don&rsquo;t explain I&rsquo;ll crown you with a chair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Patience!&rdquo; The young Italian held out a
hand. &ldquo;All must be done in proper form. One
moment. I shall light the fire. The kettle shall
simmer. Before the fire all will be confessed.
And after this we shall lay the plot, and what
a plot it will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Removing a heavy wire screen, Angelo
dropped on his knees before a broad fireplace.
A match flickered and a yellow flame appeared.
As if by magic, the place that a moment before
had seemed a theatre became an artist&rsquo;s retreat
glowing with light and warmth. At the
right of the fireplace, where real flames went
roaring skyward, was a broad wooden seat.
Here, amid many bright pillows, Petite Jeanne
and Florence were soon enthroned. The
young host and his companions threw themselves
upon thick rugs before the fire.</p>
<p>The lights were put out. The yellow glow
of flames playing upon Angelo&rsquo;s dark face
transformed him seemingly into quite another
being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; Florence whispered. &ldquo;He is like a
god in ancient bronze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not so ancient as this.&rdquo; With fingers
that trembled Petite Jeanne placed the gypsy
god on the very border of the flames.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>The transformation that followed instantly
was startling. Florence jumped from her
place. The big, blonde musician sprang
backward. Angelo stared with wide eyes. As
for Dan Baker, he stared at the thing with the
fascination of a child.</p>
<p>And Jeanne? She merely smiled. Many
times, at the back of hedges in the dead of
night, or hidden away in some black forest, she
had seen this thing, had witnessed the transformation
of something that appeared all
metal into a being that seemed alive with savage,
fantastic grandeur: the gypsy God of
Fire.</p>
<p>Even as they stared, voiceless, intent, motionless,
a sound startled them all&mdash;the rattling
of a windowpane in the skylight several
feet above their heads.</p>
<p>Instantly all eyes were on that window.
Everyone there knew that it was a silent, star-lit
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It rattled!&rdquo; Jeanne whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is no wind!&rdquo; Florence answered
low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>As they looked, a mellow glow overspread
the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;What is it?&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s eyes were
staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That?&rdquo; Angelo laughed a low laugh.
&ldquo;That is only the gleam of Lindbergh Light,
the airplane beacon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But does it always rattle the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light? Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this,&rdquo; the young Italian added quickly,
&ldquo;this is nothing. Come! We are wasting
time. To-night, by this fire, we shall lay the
groundwork for such a light opera as has never
been known before. You, Swen,&rdquo; he turned
to the big blonde, &ldquo;you are to write the music.
I shall write the play. And these, our friends,
are to be the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful dream!&rdquo; Petite Jeanne murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dream for a night. A reality forever!&rdquo;
The Italian youth flung his arms wide in the
characteristic gesture that the little French
girl loved to see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; he exclaimed as the fire died down
to the orange glow of a sunset. &ldquo;The ugly
little god smiles. It is an omen of good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked, and indeed the curious thing
from the heart of the earth or from some distant
planet (who could tell which?) seemed to
smile.</p>
<p>But again Petite Jeanne shuddered; for, at
that precise moment the window sash rattled
again, this time with an unmistakable bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; urged Angelo, &ldquo;snap out of it. It&rsquo;s
only the wind. We&rsquo;ll make a beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait. Wait but one little minute!&rdquo; the
French girl pleaded. She pressed her hand
over her throbbing heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she murmured as she sank back
among the cushions, &ldquo;it is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, then!&rdquo; Angelo began in the grand
manner. &ldquo;You, Petite Jeanne, are, just as you
were in France, a refugee. No mother; no
father; only a dancing bear. The gypsies,
good gypsies, the best in all France, have befriended
you. From village to village you
have danced your way across France. All
France has come to know and love you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;But now&mdash;&rdquo; He paused for emphasis.
&ldquo;This is where our play shall begin, just here.
Now your bear seems at the point of death.
He lies in the shadows, out of sight. But the
gypsies, gathered about the camp fire that
burns before the gaily painted wagons, are
conscious of his presence. They, too, are sad.
Sad because they love you and your ponderous
dancing companion; sad, as well, because no
longer the coins will jingle at your feet when
the dance of the bear is ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The light of the fire dispels the dark shadows
of night for but a short distance. At the
edge of those shadows, unobserved by those
about the camp fire, sits an old man. His hair
is long. It curls at the ends. His battered hat
is drawn low over a mellow, kindly face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man&mdash;&rdquo; He turned suddenly toward
Dan Baker. &ldquo;That man is no other than yourself,
Dan. You, too, are a wanderer. Down
the road a short distance is a small tent. Close
by are two burros. You are an old time prospector.
All over America, with pick and pan,
you have wandered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some one has told you that there is gold
to be found in the hills of France. And here
you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; Dan Baker echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have found no gold. You have found
something better&mdash;a beautiful young lady in
distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The color in Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s cheek deepened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gypsies have given up hope. For
them the bear is as good as dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;&rdquo; He turned again to Jeanne.
&ldquo;You have not despaired. For, is there not
still the Dance of Fire? Is not the gypsy God
of Fire close beside you? And have not this
dance and this god worked miracles in the
past?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Italian paused to prod the fire.
As it blazed up the face of the gypsy god was
illumined in a strange manner. His lips appeared
to part. He seemed about to speak.
Yet no sound was heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; cried Petite Jeanne. &ldquo;He approves!
We shall succeed! Truly this is my luckee
day!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Once more Angelo held up a hand for silence.
&ldquo;So there,&rdquo; he began again, &ldquo;by the
gypsy camp fire, with all your dark-faced companions
gathered about you, and with the God
of Fire smiling at you from the very heart of
the flames, you dance the gypsy Dance of
Fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if this were a cue, the little girl, half
French, half gypsy, sprang to her feet and
before the curious god, gleaming there at the
edge of the flame, danced her weird dance as
it had never been danced before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! Bravo!&rdquo; shouted Swen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! Bravo!&rdquo; they all echoed. &ldquo;The
play will be a great success even if there is
nothing more than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be more&mdash;much more!&rdquo; Angelo
shouted joyously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you dance,&rdquo; he began again a moment
later, when Petite Jeanne had settled back
among her cushions, &ldquo;an aged gypsy woman
creeps from the shadows to whisper a word in
the ear of the chief of the tribe. Word is
passed round the circle. A great sadness falls
over all. The Dance of Fire has failed. The
dancing bear will dance no more. He is dead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;At a glance the dancer learns all. The
dance ended, she flings herself before the fire
in an attitude of grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence; the golden moon; the campfire;
the bright painted wagons; and sorrow, such
deep sorrow as only a gypsy knows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then a curious thing happens. An old
man, whose gray hair hangs down to his shoulders,
comes dancing into the golden circle of
light. As he enters the circle he exclaims:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why be sad? See! I am sent by the Fire
God to fill the place of Tico, the bear. I shall
be this beautiful one&rsquo;s dancing partner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gypsies are surprised and, for the moment,
amused. They ridicule him in true
gypsy fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he dances on and on, however, silence
steals over the camp. They begin to realize
that he is a marvelous dancer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;He begins the gypsy dance to the harvest
moon. Petite Jeanne springs to her feet and
joins him. Her face is wreathed in smiles.
She believes the God of Fire truly has sent this
one to be her partner; else how could he dance
so divinely?</p>
<p>&ldquo;As they dance on about the fire, they are
joined by others, many beautiful gypsy maidens,
dressed in colorful gypsy fashion. This is
our chorus. They will appear often, but this
will be the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelo paused for breath. The room went
strangely silent. The fire had burned low.
Still the God of Fire appeared to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the dance is over,&rdquo; he took up the
thread of the story once more, &ldquo;the mysterious
dancer binds the bargain by presenting the
chief with a double eagle, twenty dollars in
gold. Then he vanishes into the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instantly it is murmured that this is some
very rich American in disguise. For, as you
must know, the French think all Americans
are rich. And here, with the gypsies speculating
in regard to the future, and Petite Jeanne
gazing raptly at the gypsy god who has
brought her such good fortune&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; The young Italian prodded the fire
vigorously. &ldquo;See? He smiles! He approves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this time Jeanne did not see, for once
more the window above them had rattled.
And this time, as the beacon cast its glow upon
the glass, there appeared a shadow, the shadow
of a man, the man who had without doubt
been looking down upon them and upon the
smiling gypsy god.</p>
<p>Both light and shadow were gone in an instant.
Not, however, until the keen eyes of
the little French girl had identified the one
who had cast that shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At such a time and such a place!&rdquo; she whispered
to herself, as a shudder ran through her
slight form. To her companions she said not
a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as far as we go to-night.&rdquo; Angelo
rose from his place by the fire and dropped
limply into a chair. Gone was the fire in his
dark eyes. His spell of inspiration at an end,
he desired only rest and peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Florence,&rdquo; he passed a hand across his
face, &ldquo;the water in the kettle is steaming. Will
you honor us by making tea? There&rsquo;s black
tea in the green can on the mantel and a lemon
yonder on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Florence hastened to do her bit toward
making the evening a complete success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I move we meet again to-morrow night.
And here&rsquo;s to success!&rdquo; exclaimed Swen, holding
his cup high as tea was poured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second the motion!&rdquo; There was a suspicious
huskiness in Dan Baker&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;Think
of stirring hopes like these in an old man&rsquo;s
breast! Been twenty years since I dreamed of
doing big time in a great city. And now I
dream once more. We will succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must!&rdquo; Angelo agreed fervently. &ldquo;We
must!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; his tone took on its former vigor,
&ldquo;you see me here very comfortable indeed.
Rugs, chairs, a fireplace, a stage&mdash;all very
snug. All these were purchased with money
received for one act plays written for the radio.
That contract is ended; the money is nearly
gone. Two more months and unless some
fresh triumph comes along these,&rdquo; he spread
his arms wide, &ldquo;all these must leave me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;But they will not.&rdquo; Petite Jeanne gripped
his arm impulsively. &ldquo;They shall not. We
will help you keep them. Yes! Yes! And
you shall have much more that is truly beautiful.
You shall see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />THE HOLE IN THE FLOOR</h2>
<p>Many times, as they journeyed homeward
that night, Petite Jeanne cast apprehensive
glances over her shoulder. More
than once, as some object appeared to move in
the darkness, she felt a great fear gripping at
her heart, and had it not been for the presence
of her staunch companion she would doubtless
have gone fleeing into the night.</p>
<p>The cause of her fear, the gypsy god, was
safely tucked away under her arm. This did
not allay her fear. It only served to increase
it, for had she not seen the shadow cast upon
Angelo&rsquo;s windowpane? And had she not recognized
that shadow as belonging to the very
gypsy who had pursued her in the darkness
of that very morning?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is very strange about this gypsy god,&rdquo;
she said to Florence, as with a sigh of relief
she sank into the depths of her own easy chair
in their own little room. &ldquo;One does not understand
it at all. This god has been in the
possession of the gypsy tribe of Bihari, my
gypsy stepfather. As chief of the tribe he has
watched over it for many years. Bihari is not
in America. If he were I should know. Good
news travels far in the wide world of the
gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he is not here, why is the God of
Fire in this land? There can be but one answer.
The tribe of Bihari would never part
with so priceless a possession. It has been
stolen and sent to America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then lost in the express.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who would steal it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can say? Perhaps a gypsy who hates
Bihari. There are many such. Perhaps only
some sight-seeing Americans. There are
some who would steal the Arch of Triumph
in Paris as a souvenir if they could.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;But is it so wonderful?&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s tone
was cold. Petite Jeanne had placed the
strange object of their discussion upon the
mantel. There, far from the glow of a fire, the
thing seemed hideous, smoke-blackened, dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can tell all?&rdquo; Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s voice
trailed off into a weary silence.</p>
<p>When she spoke again it was as with the
lips of a philosopher:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can know all? The gypsies believe
that the fire dance and this god give them
strength and courage, that their sick are
healed, that by these their fortunes are
mended. There are those who have been to
many schools and who should know much
more than the poor, wandering gypsies, but
they believe in even stranger things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only know that this god, this God of Fire,
is very old and that I believe in his power because
I was taught to do so as a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the gypsies of America desire this
god!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang suddenly to her feet and began
pacing the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed Florence, &ldquo;they can&rsquo;t
even know it is here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;One of them does. He saw it smiling in the
fire to-night. I saw his shadow on the windowpane.
He will tell others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could have been none other. I recognized
him instantly. His coat, his curious hat,
his profile, were all visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must guard this god well. We
must keep him in hiding.&rdquo; She went to the
door and locked it. &ldquo;I must have him for our
opera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you could have a model made of clay.
You could use that on the stage. No one
would know. Few stage properties are real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; The little French girl held up
hands in protest. &ldquo;Never! I will dance only
before the true God of Fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Florence calmly, &ldquo;you will run
a great risk. Some of the gypsies will attend
the play. They are fond of drama. This one
you saw will see the god. He will have it at
any cost.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; said the little French girl,
dropping into a chair and folding her slender
hands. &ldquo;But truly, my friend, there is no
other course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Florence sprang to her feet.
&ldquo;Since we are to have his Reverence, or his
Highness&mdash;or how do you speak of a god?&mdash;we
must find him a safe resting place. Where
can we hide him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A careful scrutiny of their narrow quarters
revealed no safe hiding place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your trunk? My dresser drawer? Under
the mattress?&rdquo; Petite Jeanne sighed. &ldquo;May as
well set him up here in the middle of the floor.&rdquo;
She placed the figure on the polished pine
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see!&rdquo; Florence leaped forward.
&ldquo;Some one has cut a hole in the floor. I wonder
why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some dark secret&rsquo;s hidden there,&rdquo; the little
French girl whispered.</p>
<p>Florence had spoken the truth. In the very
center of the floor three boards had been cut
through twice. The pieces between the cuts,
each some ten inches long, had been rudely
pried up by the aid of some instrument. Something
had undoubtedly been done; then the
boards had been pounded back in place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; exclaimed Florence, reaching for a
heavy iron poker that stood by the fireplace.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her first attempts to pry up the boards
were unsuccessful. The poker slipped, then
bent. When Petite Jeanne supplemented her
labors with a broken case knife their labors
were rewarded. The short length of board
sprang from its place.</p>
<p>Eagerly they pressed forward to look, and
bumped their heads together doing so. Then
they dropped back in their places with a merry
laugh.</p>
<p>The hidden secret was no secret at all. The
house, being a very old one, had been erected
before the coming of electric lights. When
installing the lights the electricians had found
it necessary to open the floors of the upper
rooms in order that they might install lights
for the lower floors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Florence sighed. &ldquo;What a disappointment!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Petite Jeanne. &ldquo;See what we
have found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found! What have we found?&rdquo; Florence
stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have found a safe place of hiding for
my ancient friend, the God of Fire. How
sweet! We have only to lift the boards, lower
him to the laths below, batten down the hatch
once more, and there you have him as snug
as a diamond in a new setting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re keen!&rdquo; Florence put out a hand to
pat her friend&rsquo;s blonde head. &ldquo;Now we can
sleep in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they did, awakening at a late hour
to a world of sunshine and high hopes. Nor is
there reason to believe that his Highness objected
in the least to the darkness of his place
among the beams and plaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />HAPPY DAYS</h2>
<p>Happy days followed. Petite Jeanne,
whose circle of true friends in this great
world had been pitiably small, found her horizon
greatly enlarged. Truly the day of adventures
in Merry&rsquo;s cellar and out in the park
while she danced the sun up from the depths
of the lake had been her lucky day. For one
might well have gone about the city of three
million souls holding a lamp before every face
without finding the equal to that brave trio,
Angelo the playwright, Swen the maker of
melodies and Dan Baker the beloved vagabond
of the stage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Happy days they were, and busy ones as
well. Each evening found them assembled in
Angelo&rsquo;s studio. In order that they might
talk as they ate, they brought dinner along.
Each member of the little group contributed
something. Swen provided chops, steaks,
oysters or fish; Angelo added such strange
viands as he could devise, curious hot Mexican
dishes, rich preparations from his native
land, or unthinkable Russian mixtures; Florence
and Petite Jeanne arrived each evening
with apple-squares, date-tarts or some other
form of tempting dessert; Dan Baker practiced
the ancient and all but lost art of coffee brewing
so skilfully that after drinking they all
felt that dawn was on the point of breaking,
and they were ready to walk out into a dewy
morn.</p>
<p>Wild, hilarious, dizzy hours followed. Was
a light opera ever before produced in such a
fantastic fashion?</p>
<p>Angelo was continuously prepared with
fresh script. This dark-eyed youth was a
worker. Swen kept pace with musical compositions.</p>
<p>And how Swen could beat out those melodies
on the battered piano reposing in the corner!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>When it was music for her dance Petite
Jeanne, bare-footed, bare-armed, with eyes
shining, sprang into motion with such abandon
as made her seem a crimson cardinal, a
butterfly, a mere flying nothing.</p>
<p>How Swen would throw back his blonde
mane and laugh! How Dan Baker shook his
old head and sighed with joy!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our play!&rdquo; he would murmur. &ldquo;Our play.
How can it fail? With such an angel of light
even Heaven would be a complete success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So for hours they labored. Testing music,
words, lighting effects, dances, everything,
until their heads were dizzy and their eyes
dim.</p>
<p>Then, as the blaze flamed up in the broad
fireplace, they cast themselves upon Angelo&rsquo;s
rugs of wondrous thickness and softness, and
sighed deep sighs of content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderful it is to have beautiful
things!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed, as on one of these
occasions she buried her white hands in the
thick, velvety surface of a Persian rug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; Angelo sighed. &ldquo;When you are
sure you are to keep them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;But they are your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Now they are mine. They belonged
to some one else before me. They may
belong to others. The success of our play,
that alone, will make them secure. My happiness,
yours, all our joy depends upon that.&rdquo;
A shadow fell across his dark face.</p>
<p>This shadow reminded Petite Jeanne of a
wider shadow that had been sweeping over
the wondrous land men called America. For
long years this land had known such joyous
prosperity as no land before had ever known.
But now, as if struck by some mysterious
blight, this prosperity was falling away. Factories
had been closing. Streets that once
were thronged with shoppers, were thronged
no more. Stores and shops were all but deserted.
Wise men said, &ldquo;Prosperity will return.
It is just around the corner.&rdquo; Yet it did
not return at once.</p>
<p>And Petite Jeanne, sensitive soul that she
was, ever conscious of the woes that come to
others, was touched by the signs of fear and
distress that she saw all about her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>When she spoke of it to Angelo he, too, appeared
distressed, not for himself, but for
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will make no difference to our play,&rdquo;
was his optimistic pronouncement. &ldquo;When
hard times come, the people feel the need of
amusement, diversion, more than before.
Only one playhouse in our city is dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, where is our play to open?&rdquo; Jeanne
asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me.&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;Plays
come. Plays go. A house dark to-night will
be aglow to-morrow. I have friends. Once
our light opera is on, it will go on forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they labored and hoped, shouted, danced,
sang, dreamed, despaired and hoped again,
only at last to go creeping away in the wee
small hours to seek sleep. And the morning
hours knew them not. So passed fourteen
happy, busy, delirious days.</p>
<p>All this time the light opera was taking
form. At the close of Act I the gypsy caravan,
with Petite Jeanne and Dan Baker riding on
burros, departed for Paris.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>In Paris Petite Jeanne and her amiable substitute
for the bear danced in the beautiful
public gardens. There, surrounded by noble
statues and flowering trees, they were discovered
by the chorus who at this time were
dressed in bright smocks, posing with brushes,
stools and easels as artists from the Latin
Quarter.</p>
<p>They joined the pair in a beautiful &ldquo;Dance
of the Flowers,&rdquo; and then lingered to sketch
Dan Baker, Petite Jeanne and their burros.
Meanwhile Dan Baker entertained Petite
Jeanne and all who cared to listen with one of
his wondrously impossible tales of fairyland:
America across the seas.</p>
<p>Scarcely were the sketches completed, the
tales brought to an end, than a stranger, stepping
from the throng of onlookers, denounced
Dan Baker as an impostor and accused him of
being one of the richest men in America. The
ancient wanderer resented the accusation. A
fight ensued in which a burro assisted the aged
dancer to win a victory by butting his adversary
over and then sitting on him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Millionaire or no millionaire, Dan Baker
adopted Petite Jeanne as his daughter. The
next scene found them in a beautiful private
garden, all their own, still dancing.</p>
<p>A young hero appeared. He found Jeanne
dancing barefooted before a fountain and fell
madly in love with her.</p>
<p>They were interrupted by the chorus, now
doing a nature dance to spring, and arrayed
much as spring damsels are supposed to be
dressed.</p>
<p>A villain appeared in the shadows. He had
discovered that Petite Jeanne, who had lived
after the death of her parents with wandering
gypsies, was rich in her own name. He, a terrible
apache, proposed to kidnap her.</p>
<p>The plot grew apace. Dan Baker told one
more story while the villain stood not ten feet
away, ready, if need be, to stab him.</p>
<p>The fool of the play, a young Scotchman
who missed every golden opportunity because
he held his pennies too tightly gripped, appeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>By the aid of the chorus, now dressed as
wild and terrible apache damsels, Petite
Jeanne was kidnapped.</p>
<p>The fool barely missed eternal glory by rescuing
her. He took a three cent subway car
instead of spending a whole nickel on the plush
seated car boarded by the villain and his band.</p>
<p>The last scene was in a stone paved, walled
court of a fearsome secret prison, where Dan
Baker, who had become a voluntary prisoner,
revived the fainting Jeanne with one more
romantic tale.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the hero, at the head of a brave
band of gendarmes, who in the end proved to
be the chorus in disguise, stormed the secret
prison and rescued the fair gypsy maid.</p>
<p>The truth of her riches was revealed to
Jeanne. She wept on the hero&rsquo;s shoulder.
Then she and Dan Baker, joined once more by
the chorus&mdash;this time in the most gorgeous of
filmy French creations&mdash;danced the wild
Dance of the Fire God beneath the moon while
the ancient god, lighted in some magical way,
beamed and grimaced at them from the
dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Such was the rough outline for the opera,
presented by Angelo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he added many times, with a
smile, &ldquo;the young hero may turn up later with
a rich, pompous and irate mother who does
not purpose to marry her son to a gypsy.
There may be many other complications. But
we shall iron them out one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortune is with us in one respect. The
plot of a light opera is never very closely knit.
So long as there is music and dancing, mirth
and song, all is well. And that we shall have in
superabundance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are we to get the donkeys?&rdquo;
Petite Jeanne asked on one occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; exclaimed Dan Baker. &ldquo;Nothing
is easier. There are nearly as many donkeys
on the stage as off it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The laugh went round.</p>
<p>When it had subsided Angelo said: &ldquo;I
know where there are two burros, in a vacant
lot on the west side. They&rsquo;ve been on the
stage in vaudeville. One is trained to bowl a
man over and sit on him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;So, you see,&rdquo; his grin broadened as he
turned to Dan Baker, &ldquo;I have written that part
expressly for him, just as I have for the other
donkeys in the cast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The laugh was now on Dan Baker. He responded
by narrating one more fantastic yarn,
and the work went on.</p>
<p>Then came the night when Angelo exclaimed
over the last wild dance, when even
Florence joined in the ballet, &ldquo;It is enough!
To-morrow I go to seek a producer. To-night,
before you sleep, say a little prayer for our
success.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Let us hope no one will be shocked when we
declare that on that night, long after Florence
was lost in slumber, Petite Jeanne crept from
the warm bed to the cold floor, pried up the
loose boards, drew forth the hidden God of
Fire and whispered to him some words that
sounded suspiciously like a prayer. For, after
all, you must recall that Petite Jeanne was
more than half gypsy. Besides, she was dreadfully
in earnest. For had she not, in an impersonal
way, come to love very much the
fiery little composer, the blonde-maned musician
and, most of all, the appealing old trouper,
he of long gray locks and plaintive, melodious
voice? For these more than for herself she
wished the light opera to be a great and lasting
success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />A FACE OF GRAY STEEL</h2>
<p>Angelo had a few well chosen friends
in the world of stage people. As soon as
offices were open the next morning, his card
was presented to one of these. An hour later,
with a bulky manuscript under his arm and a
letter of introduction in his pocket, he entered
the lobby of a second office.</p>
<p>He was ushered at once into the presence of
a broad shouldered, rather dull, but quite determined
appearing man who sat in a swivel
chair before a birch-mahogany desk. In another
corner of the room sat a tall, dark,
young man whose face had the appearance
of having been moulded out of chilled gray
steel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a light opera,&rdquo; said Angelo, placing his
manuscript on the desk. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll let me tell
you about it I am sure you will be able to decide
at once whether or not it will fit the Blackmoore
Theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stout man nodded.</p>
<p>Angelo began to talk. As he continued to
talk he began to glow. He was full of his
subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; The stout man held up a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drysdale,&rdquo; he said to the gray, steel-eyed
man, &ldquo;you had better sit in on this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gray Steel arose, dragged a chair forward
and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; The stout man nodded to Angelo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall&mdash;shall I begin over again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessary. Drysdale is clever. Takes
a thing in the middle, and works both ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelo talked and glowed once more. For
fully half an hour, like a small car on a country
road at night, he rattled and glowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; the stout man
demanded, when the recital was finished.
&ldquo;Drysdale, what do you think? Find a chorus,
right enough. Know one right now. House
is dark. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Paris.&rdquo; Gray Steel Face cupped his chin.
&ldquo;Americans go wild over Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they do, just wild. They&mdash;&rdquo; Angelo&rsquo;s
flow of enthusiasm was cut short by a
glower from Gray Steel Face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Drysdale is our director,&rdquo; the stout
man explained. &ldquo;Directed many plays. Very
successful. Makes &rsquo;em march. You&rsquo;re right
he does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsy stuff goes well,&rdquo; Drysdale continued.
&ldquo;But who ever heard of taking a gypsy
for a star? She&rsquo;d need training. No end of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d have to read the script. Have to see
them perform.&rdquo; Drysdale gave no heed to
Angelo. &ldquo;Say you bring &rsquo;em here to-morrow
night, say eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No stage,&rdquo; said the stout manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we have a small one,&rdquo; Angelo explained
eagerly. &ldquo;Come to my studio, won&rsquo;t
you? There you&rsquo;ll see them at their best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say, Drysdale?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be there. Mind! Eight sharp.
None of your artistic foolishness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next night, the two men did see Petite
Jeanne and Dan Baker at their best.</p>
<p>Was their best good enough? The face of
the director was still a steel mask. He conferred
with his manager in the corner of the
room for half an hour.</p>
<p>In the meantime Angelo perspired profusely.
Petite Jeanne felt hot and cold spasms
chase one another up her back, but Dan Baker
sat placidly smoking by the fire. He was an
old trouper. The road lay always before him.</p>
<p>But for Angelo and Jeanne hopes had run
high. Their ambitions were on the altar.
They were waiting for the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a contract for you by eleven
o&rsquo;clock to-morrow,&rdquo; said the stout man, in a
tone as unemotional as he might have used to
call a waiter. &ldquo;Drysdale here says it&rsquo;s a bit
crude; but emotional stuff&mdash;got some pull, he
believes. Office at eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Petite Jeanne could scarcely await their departure.
Hardly had the door closed when, in
true French fashion, she threw her arms about
the old trouper and kissed him on both cheeks.
Nor was Angelo neglected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re made!&rdquo; she cried joyously. &ldquo;The
footlights, oh, the blessed footlights!&rdquo; She
walked the young composer about the room
until she was dizzy. Then, springing like a
top, she landed in a corner by the fire and demanded
a demi-tasse of coffee.</p>
<p>As they drank their coffee Angelo was
strangely silent. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like what they said
about the opera,&rdquo; he explained, when Jeanne
teased him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll want to tear it all to
pieces, like as not, and put in a lot of half-indecent
stuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that theatre,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
frightful old barn of a place. Going to be
torn down to make way for a skyscraper next
year, I&rsquo;m told. I hope you may not hate it
too much.&rdquo; As he looked at Petite Jeanne two
wrinkles appeared on his high forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the Paris Opera,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;That
was but a small bit. I am sure I shall be quite
deliriously happy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>It was thus that she left Angelo&rsquo;s studio.
But the morrow, a gray day, was to find them
all in quite another mood.</p>
<p>When Angelo returned to the studio next
day at noon, he was in a sober mood.</p>
<p>His eyes lighted as he found a small table
standing before the fire, spread with spotless
linen and piled with good things to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, taking Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s hands
in his own, &ldquo;is your doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely, and not hardly at all,&rdquo;
laughed the little French girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a poor
cook, and a very bad manager. You may
credit it all to Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence, at that, stepped from the shadows.
For once her ready smile was not forthcoming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; he exclaimed in surprise. &ldquo;How
is it you are here? I thought you were at your
work at the gym.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no more gym,&rdquo; said the girl soberly.
&ldquo;It has been turned into a lodging
house for those poor unfortunates who in these
sad times have no place to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she added quickly, as a mellow
tone crept into her voice, &ldquo;I am glad for
them! But this leaves me exactly flat; no
job, and no prospect of one for months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No job? Of course you have one!&rdquo; Jeanne
placed an inadequate arm about Florence&rsquo;s
ample waist. &ldquo;You will be my stage &lsquo;mother&rsquo;
once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this they turned an inquiring glance
upon Angelo. For once it seemed he had nothing
to say.</p>
<p>The meal was half finished before he spoke
about the matter nearest all their hearts.
When he did speak, it was in a very indirect
manner. &ldquo;In this world,&rdquo; he began quite soberly,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s very little real generosity.
People who have money cling to it as if it had
power to carry them to the very gates of
Heaven. Those who have nothing often feel
very generous, but have nothing with which to
prove the genuineness of their feeling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Generosity!&rdquo; He almost growled. &ldquo;You
read a lot about it in the papers. Capital
agrees to do this. Big money is ready to do
that. Wages shall be kept up. Those who are
in tight places shall be dealt with in a generous
fashion. That&rsquo;s what they give out for publication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What they&rsquo;re really doing, many of them,
is undermining the uncertain foothold of those
who have very little. They&rsquo;re cutting wages
here, putting on screws there, in secret, wherever
they dare. And our friendly enemy, the
manager, who wants our light opera, old Mr.
Rockledge,&rdquo; he declared with a flourish, as if
to conclude the whole matter, &ldquo;is no exception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he give us a contract?&rdquo; asked Petite
Jeanne, as her eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. A contract. But such a contract!
He said we could take it or leave it. And old
Gray Steel Face nodded his head and snapped
his steel jaw shut, so I took it away; but we
needn&rsquo;t sign if we don&rsquo;t care to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The remainder of the meal was eaten for
the most part in silence. Just as they finished,
Swen and Dan Baker entered. They had
been for a long stroll along the lake front, and
had dined at a place which Swen had found
where they could get genuine black bread and
spiced fillet of sole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck?&rdquo; Swen demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rotten!&rdquo; Angelo threw the contract on the
table. &ldquo;Read it and weep!&rdquo; The others crowded
around to do so.</p>
<p>A silence, broken only by the rustle of
turned pages, ensued.</p>
<p>As the perusal was concluded Jeanne&rsquo;s face
was a brown study. Florence, who had read
over her shoulder, was plainly angry. Baker
neither smiled nor frowned. Swen smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Swen drawled, &ldquo;since this is to be
our first production, and success will keep the
wolf from the door for six months to come, I
don&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s so worse. One success calls
for another. And it&rsquo;s on the second that you
have a chance to tell &rsquo;em where they get off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Petite Jeanne quietly, &ldquo;that
Swen is right. It means renewed hope for all
of us. Winter is at our door. There are no
turnips in our cellar, nor hams in our smoke-house.&rdquo;
She thought of the old days in France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; agreed Dan Baker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Since Florence had no contract to sign, she
said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Angelo with a sigh, half of
relief and half of disappointment, &ldquo;we sign on
the dotted line. To-day we visit the theatre.
To-morrow rehearsals begin. The thing is to
be put on as soon as it can be whipped into
shape. Every day a theatre is dark means a
loss to its owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They signed in silence. Then, drawing
chairs before the fire, they sat down for half
an hour of quiet meditation. Many and varied
were the thoughts that, like thin smoke, passed
off into space as they lingered there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />THE CIRCLE OF BRASS</h2>
<p>They entered the theatre together at four
o&rsquo;clock that afternoon, Angelo, Dan Baker
and Petite Jeanne. It was a damp, chilly,
autumn day. Jeanne had caught the mood of
the day before they entered. There was nothing
about the empty playhouse to dispel this
disturbing gloom. The half light that was
everywhere, a small&mdash;bright torch of a lamp
here and there boring sharply into the darkness&mdash;revealed
the threadbare, neglected interior
of the place. The floor of the stage
creaked as they ventured to walk across it.
Row on row of plush seats lay dimly before
them. The few that were lighted were soiled
and faded. The once gay gilt of box seats
had cracked off in places, showing the white
beneath. The great velvet curtain drooped
woefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;How dismal!&rdquo; Jeanne spoke before she
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Dan Baker, stepping before
Angelo to conceal his look of pain, &ldquo;it is not
the house, but the people that make a theatre.
The glowing, pulsating throng of living beings.
This is a theatre. Picture this broad
stage filled with dreams of beauty and grace.
Catch a glimpse of the gay costumes. Listen
to the songs and laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yonder,&rdquo; he spread his arms wide as if
to take in a great multitude, &ldquo;yonder are the
people, hundreds, thousands! Are they less
colorful, less gay? Not one whit. For this is
their happy hour. Fans, flowers, smiles, color,
laughter, beauty. &lsquo;A thing of beauty is a joy
forever.&rsquo; No, no, my child! On our great night
you will not see the faults of this poor, gray
old house that has known the joys and sorrows
of three generations of human souls, and
which is now standing among tall skyscrapers
waiting its destruction; you will see only the
gracious people who have come to catch the
glow of light and joy that is our opera.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>As Petite Jeanne looked at him her heart
glowed with fresh fire. To her at this moment
the aged trouper, with his flowing locks and
drooping hat, was the noblest work of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, old timer,&rdquo; said Angelo. His tone
was husky as he gripped Dan Baker&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Jeanne said never a word, but as she touched
his hand ever so lightly, he understood even
better than if she had delivered an oration.</p>
<p>Her dislike of the ancient theatre, with its
narrow, ratty dressing rooms, its steep, worn
stairways and its smell of decay, was dispelled.
But with the manager, the director, the actors
she had not met before, as well as the chorus,
it was quite another matter. To her distress
she found that they, one and all, treated her
quite as an outsider. Dan Baker, too, was quite
outside their circle. He understood it, and did
not care. Having been a trouper, he realized
that in companies such as these there were
those who &ldquo;belonged&rdquo; and those who did not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>But poor, friendly, hopeful, big-hearted
Jeanne, though she was to have a leading part
in the play, had intended from the first to be a
friend to them, one and all. And behold, none
of them would accept her offering.</p>
<p>Members of the chorus might be engaged in
an animated conversation, but let her join
them and their gayety ceased while they
moved silently away.</p>
<p>Not many attempts were made before the
sensitive soul of the little French girl curled up
like an oyster in a shell. But it was an aching
little heart, at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Why?&rdquo; she demanded of her conscience,
and of her confessor, Dan Baker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; the aged dancer smiled faintly,
&ldquo;they live in what might be called a golden
circle. The circle is complete. None may
enter. It is the way of the stage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot understand,&rdquo; he said gently,
&ldquo;for you have not long been a trouper. You
could not know that they were all practically
born on the stage; that their fathers and
mothers, yes and their grandparents before
them, were stage people. They have traveled
together, some of them, for years. As they
moved from city to city, the people of each
city were only an audience to be amused.
They have made the audience laugh; they
have made it cry. But always they have
thought of that audience as a great lump of
humanity. Not one individual in that lump
cared for one of them in a personal way. Only
among their own group have they found companions.
Little by little a strong bond has
been formed. Hemming them in, it keeps
others out. That is their golden circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a most wretched circle!&rdquo; cried Jeanne
with a touch of anger. &ldquo;It is not a golden circle,
but a circle of brass, brass about their
necks; the sign of slavery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this Jeanne made no further attempts
to mingle with her fellow workers. When not
on the stage she sat in a corner, reading a
French novel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>But her cup of woe was not full. She had
hoped to dance her native dances from the
gypsyland of France, just as she had learned
them there. This was not to be. The director,
the tall, dark, youngish man, he of the chilled
steel face who never smiled, had a word to say
about this. The dances, he decreed, were not
right. They must be changed. A girl named
Eve, head of the chorus, must teach Jeanne
new steps.</p>
<p>Eve taught her, and did a thorough job of
it. Born on the west side, Eve had made her
way up by sheer nerve and a certain feeling
for rhythm.</p>
<p>No two persons could be more unlike than
this Eve and our Petite Jeanne. Petite Jeanne
was French to the tips of her toes. She loved
art for art&rsquo;s sake. Beauty and truth, sweetness
and light, these were words of infinite
charm to her. Had the same words been pronounced
to Eve, she would have suspected the
speaker of pronouncing a spelling lesson to
her. Eve lived for one thing only&mdash;applause.
It had been the thunder of applause that had
caused her to set her foot on the first round
of the ladder to fame. That same thunder
had kept her toiling year after year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Petite Jeanne cared little for applause.
When she went before an audience it was as
if she said to those assembled before her, &ldquo;See!
Here I have something all together beautiful.
It has been handed down to us through countless
ages, a living flame of action and life, a
gypsy dance. This is beauty. This is life. I
hope you may forget me and know only this
marvel of beauty and truth, sweetness and
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, under the ruthless hand of Eve,
she saw her thing of beauty torn apart and
pieced with fragments of bold movements and
discordant notes which made her dances
much more brazen.</p>
<p>But that was not all. &ldquo;Your toes,&rdquo; decreed
the merciless, dark-faced director, &ldquo;are too limber;
your legs are too stiff. You must look to
the brass rail for remedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brass rail?&rdquo; She did not say the words.
Soon enough she found out. In a cold back
room she stood for half an hour, gripping a
long brass rail safely anchored some three feet
from the floor, twisting her toes and bending
her poor limbs until she could have screamed
with pain. It helped not a bit that a dozen
members of the chorus, who never spoke a
word to her, were going through the same
painful performance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>She uttered wailing complaints to Angelo in
his studio that night. Angelo passed the complaint
on to the poker-faced manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish to direct your play,&rdquo; this dictator
decreed, &ldquo;you may do so, provided,&rdquo; he
prodded Angelo in the ribs until it hurt, &ldquo;provided
you are able and willing also to finance
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard life, my child,&rdquo; Dan Baker said
to Jeanne the next night, as the light of the
fire played on his weary old face. &ldquo;You think
the brass rail is terrible. But think of me.
They have put me in a gymnasium for an hour
each day, where a Samson of a chap uses me
for a dumbbell, an Indian club and a punching
bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne laughed at his description and felt
better.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re spoiling your dance, little girl,&rdquo; he
said in a more serious tone. &ldquo;But never mind.
Do your old dance in the old way here in this
room or in the park, just as you were doing it
when I first saw you. Keep it full of freshness,
life and beauty, stretch it to fill the time, and
when we open,&rdquo; his voice died to a whisper,
&ldquo;on our great first night, dance your gypsy
dance just as you learned it back there in
France, and I promise you that all will be
more than well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne caught her breath. Here was
a bold proposal. Would she dare?</p>
<p>Springing to her feet, she went swinging
away in a wild whirl. When she dropped back
in her place before the fire, she whispered
hoarsely,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her strong young hand met his in a grip
that was a pledge.</p>
<p>But were these things to be? Even as she
lay there blinking at the fire, some imp of darkness
seemed to whisper, &ldquo;You will never do it.
You never will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at the Fire God resting at the
edge of the flames, and thought she saw him
frown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />THE FLUTTER OF WINGS</h2>
<p>Petite Jeanne was a gifted person.
She was a dancer of uncommon ability.
Those who studied her closely and who were
possessed of eyes that truly saw things had
pronounced her a genius. Yet she was possessed
of an even greater gift; she knew the
art of making friends. Defeated by an ancient
unwritten law, in her attempt to be a
friend to the girls of the chorus, she had found
her friends among the lowly ones of the
theatre. For with all her art she never lost the
human touch.</p>
<p>She had not haunted the ratty old theatre
long before Mary, the woman who dusted
seats, Jimmie, the spotlight operator, Tom, the
stoker who came up grimy from the furnaces,
and Dave, the aged night watchman, one and
all, were her friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>That was why, on special occasions, these
people did exactly what she wanted. One
night at the ghostly hour of eleven she found
herself, bare-footed and clad in scanty attire,
doing her dance upon the stage while Jimmie,
grinning in his perch far aloft, sent a mellow
spot of light down to encircle and caress her
as a beam of sunshine or a vapory angel might
have done.</p>
<p>Dave, the watchman and her faithful guardian,
was not far away. So, for the moment,
she knew no fear. The rancorous voice of the
director, the low grumble of the manager, were
absent. Now she might dance as nature and
the gypsies had taught her, with joy and abandon.</p>
<p>Since she had fully decided that on the night
of nights, when for the first time in months
the old Blackmoore was thronged, she would
take matters into her own hands and dance as
God, the stars and all out-doors had taught
her, and feeling that only practice on the stage
itself would give her heart the courage and
her brain the assurance needed for that eventful
hour, she had bribed these friends to assist
her. And here she was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Dance on this night she did. Jimmie
watched and marveled. Such grace and simple,
joyous abandon, such true melody of
movement, such color in motion, he had not
known before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;She is possessed!
The gypsies have bewitched her! She will
never be real again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, had she given one wild leap in the
air and risen higher and higher until she vanished
into thin darkness as a ghost or an angel,
he would have experienced no astonishment.</p>
<p>Surprise came to him soon enough, for all
that. Suddenly the fairy-like arms of the
dancer fell to her sides. Her lithe body became
a statue. And there she stood in that
circle of light, rigid, motionless, listening.</p>
<p>Then, throwing her arms high in a gesture
of petition, she cried,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie! The flutter of wings! Can you
hear them? How they frighten me!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie,&rdquo; she implored, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let the spotlight
leave me! Can you hear them, Jimmie?
Wings. Fluttering wings. They mean death!
Do you hear them, Jimmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaning far forward, Jimmie heard no
wings. But in that stillness he fancied he
heard the mad beating of the little French
girl&rsquo;s heart, or was it his own?</p>
<p>So, for one tense moment, they remained
in their separate places, motionless.</p>
<p>Then, with a little shudder, the girl shook
herself free from the terror and called more
cheerily,</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! They are gone now, the wings.
Throw on a light, and come and take me home,
Jimmie. I can dance no more to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she turned to move toward the spot on
the floor where her precious God of Fire stood
leering at her, she seemed to catch a sound of
furtive movement among the shadows. She
could not be sure. Her heart leapt, and was
still.</p>
<p>Five minutes later she and Jimmie were on
a brightly lighted street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wings,&rdquo; the little French girl murmured
once more. &ldquo;The flutter of wings!&rdquo; And
again, as they neared her home, &ldquo;Wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, forget it!&rdquo; Jimmie muttered.</p>
<p>She was not to forget. She was to hear that
flutter again, and yet again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />A TOUCH IN THE DARK</h2>
<p>During all these busy days Petite Jeanne
did not entirely lose track of her friend
Merry of the smiling Irish eyes. Being endowed
with a particularly friendly nature, she
was more than glad to find friends outside the
little circle in which she moved. Besides, she
was deeply grateful to the little girl who had
led her to the place where she had, in so
miraculous a manner, purchased the priceless
Fire God for only three silver coins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the beginning of all my good fortune,&rdquo;
she said to Merry on one occasion.
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; she added quickly, &ldquo;all my very hard
work as well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>So it happened more than once that she took
the elevated train to the office where the auction
sale of unclaimed, and damaged express
packages was held every Friday. There she
sat in the front row beside Merry and enjoyed
two hours of relaxation. The endless variety
of goods on sale, from a baby buggy without
wheels to a black and white puppy with an
enticing bark, intrigued her more and more;
particularly the &ldquo;union,&rdquo; Merry&rsquo;s little circle
of choice friends.</p>
<p>To a casual observer these men would have
seemed a rough lot. Soon enough Jeanne,
with her power of looking into men&rsquo;s hearts,
learned that these men who struggled daily
for their bread had been endowed by nature
with hearts of gold.</p>
<p>Their interest in Merry was of a fatherly
and sportsman-like sort. Knowing her brother
and his handicaps they were glad to help her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Unfortunately, at this time there was little
they could do for her. Each Friday she
brought a smaller purse and carried fewer articles
away. The little basement shop, where
Tad toiled incessantly, was feeling the pinch
of hard times. Few were the visitors that
came down the cellar stairs these days, and
fewer still were the purchases they carried
away. Only when the blue eyes of the girl
spied some article for which she had an immediate
sale did she venture a bid.</p>
<p>More than once when some particular member
of the &ldquo;union&rdquo; had made a fortunate purchase
and met with an immediate sale, he
offered Merry a loan. Always the answer was
the same: a loyal Irish smile and, &ldquo;Thanks.
You&rsquo;ll be needing it next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little wonder that Petite Jeanne, sitting in
the glowing light of such glorious friendships,
absorbed warmth that carried her undaunted
through rehearsals amid the cold and forbidding
circle within the old Blackmoore walls.</p>
<p>It was on one of these visits to the auction
house that the little French girl received an
invitation to an unusual party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Weston, the ruddy-faced German who kept
a shop near Maxwell street, together with Kay
King and a stout man known by the name of
John, had bid in a large number of traveling
bags and trunks. They were an unusual lot,
these bags and boxes. Many of the trunks
were plastered from end to end with foreign
labels. Three of the bags, all exactly alike,
were of the sort carried only by men of some
importance who reside in the British Isles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I&rsquo;d love to see what&rsquo;s in them!&rdquo;
Jeanne exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to know?&rdquo; Weston demanded.
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you. Junk! That&rsquo;s all. I buy
only junk. Inside these are some suits.
Moths eat holes in them. Silk dresses, maybe;
all mildewed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be fun to open them, though. You
never can tell what you might find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ja, you can never tell,&rdquo; Weston agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to see what&rsquo;s in them?&rdquo; Kay
King, who was young and good looking,
leaned forward. &ldquo;Come down to Maxwell
Street on Sunday. We&rsquo;ll save them until then,
won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; He appealed to his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ja, sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne turned to Merry. &ldquo;Will you
go?&rdquo; she asked, suddenly grown timid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; Merry assented quickly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen their shops. I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Jeanne said with a smile.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come. And perhaps we&rsquo;ll bring some
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ja, bring friends. As many as you like.
Mebby we could perhaps sell them some suitcases?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kay King gave Jeanne his card. And there,
for the time, the matter rested. But Jeanne
did not allow it to escape her memory. It was
to be, she told herself, one of the strangest and
most interesting opening-up parties it had
been her privilege to attend.</p>
<p>That night Petite Jeanne once more danced
alone beneath the yellow glow of Jimmie&rsquo;s
spotlight. The affair of two nights before had
frightened her more than she cared to admit.
But this little French girl possessed an indomitable
spirit. She knew what she wanted; knew
quite as well why she wanted it, and was resolved
that, come what might, she should have
it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>On this particular night she would gladly
have taken her strong and fearless companion,
Florence, with her to the theatre. But Florence
had come upon a bit of good fortune; she
had been employed to conduct classes in a settlement
house gymnasium two hours each
evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she had exclaimed joyously, &ldquo;means
bread and butter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Petite Jeanne had come alone. And why
not? Was not Jimmie over there in the balcony?
And was not her friend, the night
watchman, somewhere in the building?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of the gypsy who would steal your
god if he might?&rdquo; Florence had asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of him?&rdquo; Jeanne had demanded.
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen him prowling about, have
we? Given up, and gone south. That&rsquo;s what
I think. In New Orleans by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Long ere this, as you will recall, Jeanne had
resolved what she should do on the opening
night. When the curtain rose for her first big
scene, when she received the cue to begin
her dance, she would make it <i>her</i> dance indeed.
At that moment, before the throng of first-nighters,
she would defy the tyrannical director.
She would forget the steps they had
taught her. Before the gypsy campfire she
would become a gypsy once again and dance,
as never before, that native dance to the Fire
God. Bihari, the gypsy, had taught her that
dance, and there was nothing like it in all the
world, she felt sure.</p>
<p>It was a daring resolve and might, she knew,
result in disaster. Yet the very daring of it
inspired her. And why not? Was she not
after all, in spirit at least, a gypsy, a free soul
unhampered by the shams and fake pretenses,
the senseless conventions of a city&rsquo;s life?</p>
<p>With this in mind, she danced in the dark
theatre with utter abandon. Forgetting all
but the little Fire God whose tiny eyes glowed
at the rim of the yellow circle of light, she
danced as she had many times by the roadsides
of France.</p>
<p>She had reached the very zenith of the wild
whirl. It seemed to Jimmie that she would
surely leave the floor and soar aloft, when suddenly
he became conscious that all was not
well. He read it in her face. She did not stop
dancing. She did not so much as speak; yet
her lips formed words and Jimmie read them:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wings, fluttering of wings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A plague on the wings!&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmie,
as his muscles stiffened in readiness for an
emergency.</p>
<p>Wings! Did he hear them? He could not
be sure. He would see what he could see!</p>
<p>He touched a button and a light flashed
brightly from a white globe aloft.</p>
<p>His keen eyes searched the place in vain.
Yet sixty seconds had not elapsed before there
came the sound of a slight impact, followed
by a terrific crash. The light above blinked
out.</p>
<p>In his excitement, Jimmie threw off the
spotlight and the theatre beneath him became
a well of darkness.</p>
<p>And what of Jeanne? When the crash
came her dance ended. When the spotlight
blinked out she sprang back in terror. At that
instant something touched her ankle.</p>
<p>With a little cry of fright, she bounded forward.
Her foot came in contact with some
solid object and sent it spinning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Fire God!&rdquo; she thought in consternation.
&ldquo;I have kicked him across the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the house lights flashed on, and all was
light as day.</p>
<p>Flashing a quick look about the stage, the
girl found everything as it had been, except
that the Fire God was standing on his head in
a corner, and half way down the center aisle
was a pile of shattered glass. This glass had,
a moment before, been the white globe aloft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. The
globe fell, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been loose,&rdquo; Jimmie grumbled.
&ldquo;Good thing it fell now. Might have killed
somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jeanne was sure it had not been loose.
She had not forgotten that flutter of wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;is trying to
frighten me. But I shan&rsquo;t be frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she walked to the corner of the
stage, took up her Fire God, slipped on her
coat and prepared to go home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie,&rdquo; she called, loud enough for anyone
who might be hiding in the place to hear,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s all for to-night. But come again day
after to-morrow. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O. K.,&rdquo; Jimmie shouted back.</p>
<p>Jeanne was to regret this rashness, if rashness
it might be called.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />THE BATTLE OF MAXWELL STREET</h2>
<p>&ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; Petite Jeanne stepped
back, half in terror, as she gripped
Florence&rsquo;s arm and stared about her.</p>
<p>They had just alighted from a Halsted
Street car and had entered the maze of booths,
carts, rough board counters, and wagons.
&ldquo;This is Maxwell Street on a bright Sunday
afternoon in late autumn,&rdquo; replied Merry with
a smile.</p>
<p>They were on their way, Petite Jeanne and
Merry, to the promised party at which many
mysterious bags and trunks were to be
opened. Florence was with them; so, too, was
Angelo. Dan Baker also had agreed to come
at the last moment. So they were quite a party,
five in all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>About these portable stores swarmed a
motley throng. Some were white, some
brown, some black. All, stall keepers and
prospective purchasers alike were poor, if one
were to judge by attire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; Merry smiled at the little
French girl. &ldquo;These are harmless, kindly
people. They are poor, to be sure. But in this
world, ninety out of every hundred are poor
and probably always will be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of these people have a few poor
things to sell. The others hope to purchase
them at a bargain; which indeed they often
do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; she ended, &ldquo;like other places
in the world, Maxwell Street deserves its place
in the sun, for it serves the poor of this great
city. What could be nobler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, What could be nobler?&rdquo; the little
French girl echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; she murmured as they
walked along. &ldquo;There is no order here. See!
There are shoes. Here are cabbages. And
here are more shoes. There are chickens.
Here are more shoes. And yonder are stockings
to go with the shoes. How very queer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence sighed, &ldquo;there is no order
in the minds of the very poor. Perhaps that
is why they are poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; Merry cried impatiently. &ldquo;We
must find the shops of our friends. They are
on Peoria Street. Two blocks up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead the way.&rdquo; Petite Jeanne motioned
her friends to follow.</p>
<p>As they wedged their way through the
throng, Petite Jeanne found her spirits drooping.
&ldquo;How sad it all seems!&rdquo; she thought to
herself. &ldquo;There is a little dried up old lady.
She must be eighty. She&rsquo;s trying to sell a few
lemons. And here is a slip of a girl. How
pinched her face is! She&rsquo;s watching over a
few wretched stockings. If you whistled
through them they&rsquo;d go into rags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she was ready to smile again,
&ldquo;they all seem cheerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had said this last aloud. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Merry
answered, &ldquo;cheerful and kind. Very considerate
of one another. It is as if suffering,
hunger, rags, disease, brought friends who
cannot be bought with gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is true. And such a beautiful truth.
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne broke short off, then dodged
quickly to one side. She had barely escaped
being run down by an automobile. Coming
in from behind, the driver had not honked
his horn.</p>
<p>The man was large. The companion at his
side was large. The bright blue car was large.
The whole outfit fairly oozed comfort, riches
and self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand gawking around and you&rsquo;ll get a leg
taken off!&rdquo; The driver&rsquo;s voice was harsh, unkind.
He spoke to the little French girl.</p>
<p>The hot fire that smouldered behind Angelo&rsquo;s
dark eyes blazed forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, anyway?&rdquo; he
demanded in a fury. &ldquo;Running people down!
Crowding them about! You with your big
car! If you want to gaze, why don&rsquo;t you walk
as we do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>The car came to a halt. A deep flush had
spread over the driver&rsquo;s face. Springing from
the car, he launched a blow that sent the slight
Italian youth spinning into the crowd behind
him.</p>
<p>But what was this? Hardly had the man
swayed back, a leer of satisfaction on his face,
than a whirling catapult launched itself upon
him. A circle of steel closed about his neck.
He found himself whirling through space. He
landed with a mighty clatter atop a pile of
frying pans and stew kettles.</p>
<p>Quickly scrambling to his feet, he glowered
at the gathering throng as he demanded,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the count of ten, no one answered.
Then a scrawny little Irishman, who wore a
Cross of Honor on his ragged jacket, pushed
Florence forward as he whispered hoarsely,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell &rsquo;im, Miss. I&rsquo;m wid y&rsquo;. Me, as never
lost a battle yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s words were clear and
quite distinct.</p>
<p>A hush fell over the thickening crowd. A
fight on Maxwell Street is always an occasion.
But a fight between a prosperous man and a
good looking girl! Who had seen this before?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Florence, as you will recall, was not one of
those weaklings who subsist on pickles and
ice-cream in order to develop a slender figure.
She weighed one hundred and sixty, was an
athletic instructor, knew a few tricks and was
hard as a rock.</p>
<p>There was no fight. The man looked her
up and down. Then he called her a name. It
was a nasty name, seldom heard on Maxwell
Street. For the people there, though poor,
are a gentle folk.</p>
<p>Then Maxwell Street, slow going, gentle,
kindly, poverty-stricken Maxwell Street, went
mad. Who threw the first ripe tomato that
struck this prosperous insulter squarely on the
jaw? No one will ever know. Enough that
it was thrown. It was followed quickly by a
bushel more, and after that by a cart load of
over-ripe fish.</p>
<p>When at last the irate but badly beaten man
of importance turned his car southward and
fled from Maxwell Street, his beautiful car was
no longer blue. It was tomato-pink and fish-yellow.
And his costume matched the car.</p>

<p>Then Maxwell Street indulged in a good
laugh. In this laugh Angelo did not join.
He divided his attention between the business
of nursing his swollen jaw and paying the poor
venders of tomatoes and fish for their missing
wares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people,&rdquo; he might have been heard to
grumble to himself, &ldquo;talk too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The battle of Maxwell Street!&rdquo; exclaimed
Merry at his elbow. Her eyes shone. &ldquo;And
we won!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it!&rdquo; Angelo agreed heartily.
&ldquo;However, I am out four dollars and sixty-five
cents for fish and tomatoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; Merry pointed to the battered
little Irishman with the Cross of Honor. &ldquo;He
is taking up a collection. You will be paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! That cannot be!&rdquo; True distress
was in the Italian boy&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Stop him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. We must not!&rdquo; Merry&rsquo;s tone was
tense with emotion. &ldquo;You are their hero.
You stood up for their rights. Would you be
so mean as to rob them of the right to do homage
to their hero?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, me!&rdquo; Angelo rubbed his eyes. &ldquo;This
is a very strange world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end he departed with a heavy sack
of nickels and pennies, while the crowd
shouted their approval of the &ldquo;brave little
Dago.&rdquo; And for once Angelo did not hate this
name they had given his people.</p>
<p>They had gone another block before Angelo
spoke again. What he said both puzzled and
troubled the little French girl. &ldquo;That whole
affair,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;was a <i>faux pas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could it be!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I
thought it quite wonderful. What right have
those big, bluffing bullies to run down poor
people on Maxwell Street?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; Angelo replied soberly. &ldquo;But
after all, the battle of Maxwell Street is not
our battle. This is a large city. Yet it is
strange the way we meet the same people
again and again. If that man really comes
upon me in some other place, if he finds out
what I do and where I live, he will do his best
to ruin me. That is the way of his kind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Little did Angelo guess the manner in which
his prophecy was to come true, much less the
manner of vengeance that would be employed.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne remained silent for a moment.
Then she gave Angelo&rsquo;s arm an affectionate
squeeze as she answered: &ldquo;I shall pray every
night that he may never see you even once
again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>

<br />TRAVELING MYSTERIES</h2>
<p>Even to Merry, who had never before
visited her friends on Peoria Street just
off Maxwell Street, the shop of Weston was
something of a shock. It was nothing more
than a hollow shell of a building with a great
heap of second-hand goods of all sorts piled in
one corner. Not a shelf, counter or table
adorned this bleak interior. The plaster was
cracked, the walls threatening to fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sell all in the street,&rdquo; he explained in answer
to their looks of astonishment. With a
wave of his hand he indicated rough board
counters where a miscellaneous assortment of
human beings were pawing over a stock in
trade as varied as themselves.</p>
<p>Now and again one would hold up an article
in one hand, a coin in the other, and a bargain
was speedily made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how he lives,&rdquo; Petite Jeanne
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been doing this for twenty years, and
he&rsquo;s not bankrupt yet,&rdquo; Merry whispered back.</p>
<p>They were led next to the shop of Kay
King. This boasted of some little magnificence.
There were shelves and tables and
one glass showcase. Since his principal stock
was composed of second-hand books, the wall
was lined with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A curious place for a book store, this Maxwell
Street,&rdquo; Dan Baker mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do so badly,&rdquo; Kay King smiled.
&ldquo;The poor wish to read. And here for a
nickel, a dime, a quarter, I sell them a lamp to
their feet, a light to their pathway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly a missionary enterprise in a city
wilderness,&rdquo; the gentle old man murmured.</p>
<p>As for Petite Jeanne, her eyes had roamed
up and down the dusty rows of books and had
come to rest at last upon a badly hung pair
of portieres at the back of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;is where he sleeps
when the day is done, a dark and dingy hole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;who can help admiring
him? Here in his dingy little world he
is master of his own destiny. While others
who sell books march down each morning to
punch a clock and remain bowing and scraping,
saying &lsquo;Yes mam&rsquo; this and &lsquo;Yes mam&rsquo;
that to females who think themselves superior
beings, he moves happily among his own books
selling when and as he chooses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her reflections were broken off by a word
from Kay King himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a story in every one.&rdquo; He nodded
toward the row of trunks and bags they had
come to inspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little does one dream as he packs his trunk
for a journey that he may never see that trunk
again. Sad as it may seem, this is often the
case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, all unconscious of curious prying eyes,
we tuck the very stories of our lives away in
our trunks and watch them go speeding away
in a motor van.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Petite Jeanne asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;How? Look at this. Here is one I purchased
some time ago.&rdquo; He swung a large,
strongly built wardrobe trunk about, threw it
open and produced a bundle of letters. &ldquo;This,&rdquo;
he explained, &ldquo;is a young man. These letters
are from his mother. And these,&rdquo; he produced
another packet, &ldquo;are from other women.
Still others are from his pals. They tell his
story. And what a story! Bright, well educated,
from a good family. But oh, such a
rotter! He betrays his employer, his sweetheart,
his pals. He deludes his trusting mother.
And, how he lies to her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all written here.&rdquo; He patted the letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a letter from him yesterday,&rdquo; he
continued. &ldquo;He wants the trunk; says it is a
treasure and an heirloom; wants the contents,
too; says sentiment makes him treasure these
things. Sentiment!&rdquo; He fairly stormed. &ldquo;He
knows but one emotion! He loves; ah yes, he
loves himself supremely! He has not a redeeming
trait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;He wants this trunk because he is afraid.
Afraid of me!&rdquo; His laugh was bitter. &ldquo;Me!
I never hurt a flea. I only wish I could; that
I were hard and ruthless as some men are,
stamping their way through, trampling over
others to fortune!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he shall pay,&rdquo; he went on more calmly
after a moment. &ldquo;I mean to charge him twenty
dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;I shall return this one
to its owners free.&rdquo; He placed a hand on a
sturdy little army locker. &ldquo;This one belongs
to a little family. How many trunks do!
Father, mother and the little ones, all their
clothes in one trunk! And then lost!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There should be a society for the return of
lost baggage to poor people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many like these. People come to
a strange city for work. There is no work.
They leave their trunks in the depot. Storage
piles up. They cannot pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this must bore you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Please go on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is not much more to tell. See!&rdquo; He
lifted the lid of the trunk. &ldquo;Everything is
spotlessly clean. A man&rsquo;s shirts, a woman&rsquo;s
house dresses, little frocks and rompers for
two tiny girls. Poor folks they are, like you
and me. He was a soldier, too. There is a
sharp-shooter&rsquo;s medal on a pin cushion.
There&rsquo;s a child&rsquo;s birth certificate, a doll with
its nose kissed white, and a small Bible. They
lost all that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&mdash;I shall send it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will pay you,&rdquo; said Petite Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will not pay. They cannot. Some
are always poor. These are like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this one&mdash;&rdquo; His lips curled in sudden
scorn. &ldquo;This big boy who goes strutting
through the world, he shall pay, and I shall
pass it on to these who need and perhaps deserve
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am keeping you here!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Here are the trunks we have saved for your
own eyes. You will see that Weston has spoken
truthfully. They are filled for the most part
with junk. But now and then there is a story,
a real story of some romantic life. See, this
one opens easily. I have found a key for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; On Jeanne&rsquo;s face was a look almost
of distress. &ldquo;You have told me so much.
It seems so cruel that we should pry into their
lives. It&mdash;it&rsquo;s like coming upon people in the
dark. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not half as
bad as that. Probably we won&rsquo;t come upon
anything of interest at all. Indeed that&rsquo;s almost
sure to be the case, and I am inclined to
repent inviting you here.&rdquo; So saying, he lifted
the lid of the first of the row of trunks, and
the show began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />BAGS OF FORBIDDEN TREASURE</h2>
<p>Weston&rsquo;s prophesy that the trunks
contained &ldquo;only junk&rdquo; proved to be
true. As trunk after trunk was opened, their
search for hidden treasure continued to be unrewarded.
Always there was the suggestion of
pinching poverty, carelessness and neglect.
These trunks were lost to their owners because
they had not the ready money to pay the
charges. One need not say that such as these
have few valuable treasures to pack in a trunk.</p>
<p>The air of the small shop grew heavy with
the odor of soiled clothing, cheap, highly
scented soap and spilled talcum powder. The
ladies had given up the search and were wandering
about, looking at books, when the
searching party came at last upon the three
large pigskin bags from the British Isles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is something to intrigue you!&rdquo; exclaimed
Angelo. &ldquo;And see! They are all
tightly locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kay King&rsquo;s eyes shone. He had bid in these
bags at a rather high figure. He was hoping
that his judgment regarding their contents
had been correct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me try these.&rdquo; He rattled a huge
bunch of keys. Not one of them would open
the bags. &ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;one may pick
his own locks.&rdquo; With skill born of ripe experience
he opened the locks with a bit of twisted
wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; He breathed deeply. &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all crowded around. A wide-mouthed
bag flew open, revealing its contents. At once
an exclamation was on every lip. Not one of
them all but knew on the instant that Kay had
made an exceedingly good buy. The bag was
packed to the very top with the choicest of
wearing apparel. Indeed, not one of them all
had worn such rich garments. A man&rsquo;s outfit
included shirts of finest silk and softest woolens,
suits of broadcloth and shoes of rarest
quality.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>The second bag, though varying somewhat
in its contents, matched the first in quality.</p>
<p>It was the third bag that set them gasping.
For in this one the owner had packed with
tender care the articles dearest to his heart.
An ivory toilet set mounted with gold, a costly
present from some dear friend; a brace of gold-mounted
pistols; fountain pens; paper knives,
elaborately carved; an astonishing collection
of rare articles. And at one side, carefully
wrapped in a swathing of silk, were three oval
frames of beaten gold. Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s fingers
trembled as she unwrapped them and revealed,
one after another, the portraits of a beautiful
lady, a handsome boy and a marvelous girl,
all dimples and golden hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; She breathed deeply and the breath
was half a sob.</p>
<p>More was to come. Having taken up an unframed
picture, she studied it for a space of
seconds. Then, as her trembling fingers let
the picture fall, her slender form stiffened and
her face went white as she said in words that
seemed to choke her:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t sell these things. You truly
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Kay challenged. He had
not looked into her white face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; She put out a hand to steady
herself. &ldquo;Because they belong to a friend of
mine. That is he,&rdquo; she said, holding up the
picture, &ldquo;and that,&rdquo; pointing to a signature at
the bottom, &ldquo;is his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he came over on the boat with me.
He&mdash;he was very, very kind to me. Helped
me over the hard places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To sell out these would be a sacrilege.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell them to me!&rdquo; she pleaded, laying a
hand on Kay&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you twice what
you gave for them. Please, please do!&rdquo; She
was all but in tears.</p>
<p>She could not know the bargain she appeared
anxious to drive. Only Weston and
Kay King knew. They knew that in all their
pinched and poverty-stricken lives they had
never before made such a find; that the bags
and their contents were worth not twice but
ten times what Kay had paid for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>And only Angelo, who had accidentally
caught sight of her bankbook, knew that for
the sake of a friend she had known only on a
short voyage, she was willing to spend her all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what will you do with them?&rdquo; Kay
moistened dry lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;some way I&rsquo;ll find him and give them to
him. And if&mdash;if he&rsquo;s dead I&rsquo;ll find her.&rdquo; She
pointed to the beautiful lady in the gold frame.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll find her and them.&rdquo; She nodded
toward the other portraits.</p>
<p>Kay was not one who measured out charity
in a glass and served it with a spoon. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo;
he said huskily, &ldquo;you may have them for exactly
what I paid&mdash;fifteen dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word, he snapped the bags
shut one by one.</p>
<p>A long silence followed. Merry stood this
as long as she could; then, seizing a long
strand of narrow golden ribbon that had fallen
from the trunk, she dashed round and round
the group, encircling them all in this fragile
band. Then, with a deft twitch, she thrust
herself within the band.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;is our Circle of Gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And such a circle as it is!&rdquo; Dan Baker&rsquo;s
voice wavered. &ldquo;You could break it with a
touch, yet it is stronger than bands of steel,
for such a band is but the emblem of a bond of
human hearts that must not be broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a subdued but curiously happy Petite
Jeanne who rode back to the studio that night
on a rattling street car. She felt as though
she had been at church and had joined in the
holiest of communions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is Sunday, too,&rdquo; she whispered
to Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence agreed, not a little surprised
at her words, not divining their meaning.
&ldquo;This is Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later in the day, when the shadows had
fallen across the rooftops and night had come,
Dan Baker sat dozing by Angelo&rsquo;s fireplace.
Jeanne sat at the opposite side, but she was not
sleeping. She was deep in thought. The
others had gone for a stroll on the boulevard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Jeanne was trying to recall a name, not the
name of the man who had once owned the
three bags resting there in the shadows. She
knew that. It was Preston Wamsley. But
the name of the hotel where he had stopped in
New York; this escaped her.</p>
<p>She could picture the place in her mind. She
had taken a room there for a night. It was not
one of those towering affairs of brick and
stone where traveling men uphold the prestige
of their firms by paying ten dollars a night for
a bed. A humble, kindly old hostelry, it stood
mellow with age. Within were many pictures
of great men who had stopped there in days
gone by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were Presidents and Earls and
Dukes,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Yes, and Princes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince!&rdquo; she whispered excitedly. &ldquo;Prince&mdash;Prince
George! That was the name! I&rsquo;ll
address a letter to him there to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She changed her mind a moment
later. &ldquo;To-morrow may never come. Better
do it now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>She helped herself to paper and envelope
and penned a simple note to her great friend,
saying she had his traveling bags which had,
no doubt, been lost; and where should she
send them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may reach him,&rdquo; she told herself, as
she hurried down to post it. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had cast her bread upon the waters, half
of all the bread she had in the world. And the
cruel Fates had decreed that she should shortly
have still less. For all that, her steps were
light, her heart gay, as she clambered back up
the long flight of stairs.</p>
<p>As she returned to her place by the fire, it
seemed to her that the old trouper, Dan Baker,
half hidden there in the darkness, was part of
a dim, half dream life that at this moment
might be passing forever. Her mind went
slipping, gliding back over the days that lay
in the shadows that were yesterdays.</p>
<p>She thought of the dark-faced gypsy who
had followed her on that first morning when
she was on her way to dance the sun up from
the lake. It was true that she had recognized
him. He was a French gypsy. This much she
knew. That was all. She had seen him beside
some camp fire in the land of her birth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I am sure it was he who peered
through the skylight on the first night I
danced the dance to the God of Fire,&rdquo; she told
herself. Involuntarily her eyes strayed to that
skylight. There was no shadow there now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it have been that man who stole the
God of Fire and sent it to America?&rdquo; she asked
herself. &ldquo;Did he follow, only to find that it
had been lost? And if so, what will he do to
retrieve it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing all too well the answer to this last
question, she shuddered. A strange people,
the gypsies care little for laws other than their
own. If this man felt that he could formulate
a claim to the gypsy God of Fire, he would
stop at nothing to retake it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he shall not have it!&rdquo; she clenched her
small hands tight.</p>
<p>From the gypsies she had absorbed a spirit
of determination that was unshakable.</p>
<p>She thought of the flutter of wings in the
theatre. &ldquo;Some bird,&rdquo; she reassured herself.
&ldquo;But what sort of bird? And who let him in?&rdquo;
Her mind was far from at rest on this point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Nor did the thoughts that came to her as
she recalled the &ldquo;battle of Maxwell Street&rdquo;
bring her comfort. &ldquo;Angelo was right,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;It should not have happened.
In times like these one cannot have too many
friends; but one enemy is just one too many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warming thoughts filled with great comfort
came to her only when she recalled again the
three traveling bags. &ldquo;Ah! There is joy,&rdquo; she
breathed. &ldquo;To serve another. And he was
so big and kind. Perhaps he will come for the
bags. It may be that I shall see him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this comforting thought she curled up
in her chair. And there, half an hour later
the others, on returning, found her, fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />WITHIN THE HOUR GLASS</h2>
<p>As Petite Jeanne prepared to leave her
room on the following evening for her
third secret visit to the old Blackmoore, where
she hoped once more to dance in Jimmie&rsquo;s
golden circle of light, she experienced a
strange sensation. Events had been crowding
in upon her. There was the strange gypsy,
the fluttering of wings, the battle of Maxwell
Street, the lost traveling bags. All these had,
beyond doubt, exercised a powerful influence
upon her. Be that as it may, she felt at that
moment as if she were within a great funnel
filled with sand. The sand was slipping, sliding,
gliding downward toward a vortex and
she, battling as she might, was slipping with
it. And toward what an uncertain end!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>As she closed her eyes, however, she realized
that this vision belonged to the remote
past&mdash;her very earliest childhood. In those
days, she faintly recalled, there had been in a
room of some house where she lived, an hour
glass. This hour glass was composed of two
glass funnels whose very narrow tips were
made to meet. One of these funnels had been
filled with fine sand. Then the broad ends of
each had been sealed.</p>
<p>When this hour glass was set down with the
empty funnel at the bottom, the sand trickled
slowly down from the upper one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seem to be inside the full glass,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;The sands of time are sinking and
I am sinking with them. Struggle as I may,
I sink, sink, sink!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps,&rdquo; she said with a little shudder,
&ldquo;the giant hand of Fate, passing by, will seize
the glass and turn it end for end. Then the
sand will begin trickling down upon my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought did not please her, so, shaking
herself free from it, she hastened down the
stairs and caught a bus, and whirled away
toward quite another world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>As she closed her eyes once more for a moment&rsquo;s
rest, a second vision passed before her.
A fleeting but very real vision it was, too&mdash;a
marble falcon with a broken beak looking intently
toward the sky. Then she recalled Merry&rsquo;s
words as they had parted on the previous
evening: &ldquo;Things are rather hard at times,
but the falcon still looks up, so all will be well
in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of her efforts at self-control, Jeanne
found her knees trembling as she entered Jimmie&rsquo;s
circle of light that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shame!&rdquo; She stamped her dainty foot.
&ldquo;What is there to fear? The sound of wings.
A bat perhaps, or a pigeon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as she said the words, she knew that
she was lying to herself. There were no pigeons
in the place. Pigeons leave marks.
There were no marks. Bats there could not
be, for bats pass on silent wings. Then, too,
they snap their teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; she insisted stoutly, &ldquo;and I
shall dance to-night as never before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmy was ready, later, to testify that she
carried out this promise to herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like some divine one,&rdquo; was the way he expressed
it. &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; he fairly stammered
in his enthusiasm, &ldquo;you could see her floating
about like a ghost on that dark old stage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once her feet began their tapping, Jeanne
thought only of the Fire God and her art.
Gone were thoughts of rushing wings and
crashing glass, of darkness and the terror that
lurks in the night.</p>
<p>Gone, too, was the shabby old playhouse
with its dingy drapes and tarnished gilt. She
seemed not there at all. In spirit she found
herself beside a roadway at the edge of a pleasant
village in France. It was springtime.
The scent of apple blossoms was in the air.
The dwarf pear trees that grew so close
against the wall, were green with new leaves.
The gypsies were about her, they and the
country folk. Bihari was sawing at his violin.
Jaquis was strumming a guitar and she was
dancing bare-foot on the soft grass of spring,
while the eyes of the Fire God gleamed softly
upon her. It was all so like a dream that she
wished it might last forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Slowly there drifted into that dream a
sound. At first she thought it was only a part
of the dream, the clap of night hawks&rsquo; wings as
they circled in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no!&rdquo; Her face went white. &ldquo;It is the
wings, the fluttering of wings!&rdquo; She almost
cried aloud.</p>
<p>At the same instant she became conscious
of some presence among the shadows that
circled her on every side.</p>
<p>Panic seized her. She wanted to run away;
yet she dared not. Close about her was Jimmie&rsquo;s
friendly circle of light. Beyond that was
what? She dared not stir from that circle.</p>
<p>Suddenly her dancing ceased. Standing
there alone in that sea of darkness, she
stretched slim arms high, and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie! Jimmie! I&rsquo;m terribly afraid!
Don&rsquo;t leave me! Please, please don&rsquo;t let the
light fade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie read real terror in her eyes, and in
his honest devotion would have risked anything
to save her from the unknown terror
that lurked in the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>But he was helpless for in an instant the
place went black. He had not touched a
switch, yet his light had blinked out. His
head whirled. His trembling hand found a
switch, threw it on. Still no light. Another
and yet another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house is dark! The wires are cut!&rdquo; he
told himself frantically.</p>
<p>Feeling his way along the aisle, he began
stumbling down a stairway when to his startled
ears there came a long drawn, piercing
scream.</p>
<p>After that followed silence, silence such as
only an empty playhouse holds in the dark
night.</p>
<p>For a full minute he saw nothing, heard
nothing. Then came a sound. Faint, yet very
distinct it came, and appeared to cross the hall
from end to end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wings,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Just what she
said. The flutter of wings!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />&ldquo;KIDNAPED&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Jimmie went at once for the watchman.
He was some time in finding him. At last
he stumbled upon him in the front corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one&rsquo;s been tryin&rsquo; the door. Don&rsquo;t
know what it was about. Gone now, I guess.
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Jimmie broke in. &ldquo;A terrible
thing&rsquo;s happened. The girl&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Jimmie spread his arms excitedly.
&ldquo;Who can tell? She&rsquo;s been carried
off, I tell you! Devil&rsquo;s got her, like as not.
Never did like that Fire God thing; gypsies
and devils, witches and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose your head, son!&rdquo; The watchman
laid a hand gently on his shoulder. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
about the place somewhere. We&rsquo;ll find her.&rdquo;
He gave a hitch to the big gun he always carried
under his left arm and led the way.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne was not &ldquo;about the place
somewhere.&rdquo; At least, if she was she was securely
hidden. They did not find her.</p>
<p>At last in despair Jimmie called Angelo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; he said over the telephone.
&ldquo;Vanished, and the Fire God thing has gone
with her. She screamed once after the light
blinked out. Some one threw the master-switch.
She&rsquo;s gone I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelo called Florence. Half an hour had
not passed before they were at the theatre.
The police had also been notified. Three plain
clothes men were there.</p>
<p>Between them they only succeeded in discovering
that a side door was open and that
Jeanne was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>When all hope of discovering the little
French girl&rsquo;s whereabouts deserted them, they
left the place to the police, to spend a miserable
hour before the fire in the studio. Without
Jeanne, the place was dead. Without Jeanne&mdash;no
one said it, but everyone thought it&mdash;the
light opera, which had cost so much labor, and
upon which so much happiness and success
depended, was a thing of the past. Jeanne&rsquo;s
part was written for her. Not another person
in all the world of stage people could play it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; Angelo rose and paced the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kidnaped!&rdquo; Dan Baker&rsquo;s face looked gray
and old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; Florence looked
the picture of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a doubt of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ransom, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ransom!&rdquo; The girl laughed. It was not
a happy laugh. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d pay it, you or I?&rdquo;
She went through the gesture of emptying her
pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d hope the manager might. There&rsquo;s
been a lot of things done to stage people these
last years. Blackmail. Graft. No end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the gypsies,&rdquo; said Swen.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d she get that God of Fire?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bought it. Seventy-five cents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-five cents!&rdquo; Swen stared.</p>
<p>Florence told him the story of the Fire God.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; said Swen.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a queer lot, these Romanies. I&rsquo;ve
been studying them in their flats over by the
big settlement house. Picked up some fantastic
bit of music for the play. Got their own
laws, they have. Don&rsquo;t care a rap for our laws.
If they wanted Jeanne and her god, they&rsquo;d
take her. That&rsquo;s their way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime the hour was growing late.
The manager and director must be faced in the
morning. An important rehearsal had been set
for nine A. M. Angelo could shut his eyes
and picture the director&rsquo;s rage when Jeanne
failed to show up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to be told,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dan Baker understood, &ldquo;he will.
What is worse, he&rsquo;ll have to know how and
why. We can&rsquo;t tell him why. But when we
tell him how it all came about and just what
she was doing at the time, then may the good
Father be kind to us all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll face it all better if we have a little
sleep.&rdquo; Florence moved toward the door. The
party broke up. A very sad party it had been.</p>
<p>As Florence rode home she closed her eyes
and allowed the events of the past weeks to
drift through her mind. These had been happy,
but anxious weeks. To her, as to millions
of others during this time of great financial
depression, when millions were out of work
and hunger stalked around the corner, there
had come the feeling that something great,
powerful and altogether terrible was pressing
in upon her from every side.</p>
<p>The loss of her position had depressed her.
Still, hope had returned when she secured part-time
work at night.</p>
<p>Most of all she had been concerned with the
success of the little French girl. Having induced
her to come to America, Florence felt
a weight of responsibility for her. Her continued
success and happiness rested heavily
upon Florence&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; She sighed unhappily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>But after all, what could have happened?
She thought of the dark-faced gypsy Jeanne
had spoken of; thought, too, of the Fire God
that had fallen from some planet, been forged
beneath the palms in some tropical jungle, or
in one way or another had found its way into
the wayside camps and the superstitious hearts
of the gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There might be many who would risk life
itself to come into possession of it,&rdquo; she told
herself.</p>
<p>She thought of the curious phenomena that
twice had frightened the little French girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wings,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Wings! The
flutter of wings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conductor called her station. Startled
out of the past by the needs of the immediate
present, she dashed off the street car, only to
find herself thinking of the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;what of to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How many millions had asked that same
question during these trying times! And how
varied were the answers!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />A FALCON COMES TO LIFE</h2>
<p>It was the keen blue eyes of the Irish girl,
Merry, that made an important discovery
connected with Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>Knowing that Merry was up bright and
early every morning, Florence called her at
seven o&rsquo;clock the next morning to tell her of
Jeanne&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what can have happened?&rdquo; the girl
asked in tearful consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied Florence, &ldquo;is just what we
all would like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming down,&rdquo; Merry announced.
&ldquo;Coming right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come to the theatre. I&rsquo;m going
there at once. The night watchman is on till
eight. He&rsquo;ll let us in. Places never look the
same by the light of day. We may discover
some clue.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>And indeed they did. As has been said, it
was Merry who came upon it. She was passing
through a narrow corridor between two
doors, when something caused her to look up
at the sill of a narrow window just above her
head.</p>
<p>At once she let out a little cry of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Marble Falcon!&rdquo; She could scarcely
believe her eyes.</p>
<p>The next instant she did not believe them,
for the thing resting there on the window sill
turned its head slowly, as though it were set
on a wooden pivot, and then quite as slowly
winked an eye.</p>
<p>Merry felt her knees sinking beneath her.
Gripping the doorknob, she stood there shaking
until her senses returned.</p>
<p>She recovered just in time to seize a thin
silken cord that dangled from one of the creature&rsquo;s
feet. At that instant the falcon, a real
one and quite alive, spread two very capable
wings and went flapping away through the
half open door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Only the silken line held tightly in the Irish
girl&rsquo;s hand prevented him from soaring aloft
as he had, without doubt, done on other occasions.</p>
<p>Merry gave a little cry as he came fluttering
down and alighted on one of her outstretched
hands. The cry attracted Florence&rsquo;s attention.
She came hurrying up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A falcon, a real live falcon!&rdquo; cried Merry.
&ldquo;Now, what do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A live falcon!&rdquo; Florence stared in astonishment.</p>
<p>Then she went into a brown study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wings,&rdquo; she murmured after a time. &ldquo;The
flutter of wings. Those were her very words.
Merry, you may have made an important discovery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me once,&rdquo; replied the Irish girl,
&ldquo;that gypsies were very fond of falcons. Do
you think there could be anything in that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be.&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s tone was
thoughtful. &ldquo;There may be a whole lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do next?&rdquo; Merry
demanded with a sudden start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must stay right here until nine o&rsquo;clock.
There was to have been a rehearsal at that
hour. The director will be furious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if she could help it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the trouble. You see she really
had no business being here at that hour. And
she was doing a thing that would have angered
them beyond words, should they have found it
out. How can we tell them anything without
going into the whole affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not an Irish question,&rdquo; Merry
smiled, &ldquo;so you can&rsquo;t expect an Irishman to
answer it. We Irish folk tell the blunt, unadorned
truth. If that means a fight, then we
fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; she added whimsically, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think we mind a good fight much, either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going
to stay for the scrap, I&rsquo;m not. It&rsquo;s not my
fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;ve something I want to try out.
You don&rsquo;t mind, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>With that, the strange little girl from the
shop of broken gifts gathered the silk cord
into her hands, and with the falcon still
perched upon her wrist, walked down the corridor
and out into the sunlit street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />THE FALCON&rsquo;S FLIGHT</h2>
<p>Unfortunate for those who awaited
him was the mood of Drysdale, the director,
on that particular morning. Perhaps
he had not slept well. His breakfast may have
been overdone, or cold. Men with hard heads,
narrow hearts and few smiles seldom sleep
well, and rarely do they enjoy their breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he demanded as he saw his
watch point to the hour of nine. &ldquo;Where is
this young gypsy dancing queen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Until this moment he had been told nothing.
Hoping against hope that some miracle would
bring Petite Jeanne back to them in time for
the rehearsal, Angelo, Florence and Dan Baker
had put off the inevitable.</p>
<p>Seeing that the zero hour had arrived, Angelo
climbed out of the trenches. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
gone,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; The gray steel face took on the
color of glowing metal. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be here?
What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been kidnaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kidnaped! How? When? Why wasn&rsquo;t
I notified?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No reason.&rdquo; Angelo was still calm. &ldquo;All&rsquo;s
been done that could be done. The police were
here last night. They looked the place over.
No clues. She&rsquo;s gone. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police? Here? Last night? This place?
Why here last night?&rdquo; Suspicion had been
added to the anger in this man&rsquo;s hard heart.</p>
<p>Seeing that he had given the thing away,
Angelo made a clean breast of the whole
affair.</p>
<p>The face of the director, as he learned that
Petite Jeanne had been practicing her old
dances at night in his theatre with the intention
of using those dances on the opening
night, was a terrible thing to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That!&rdquo; he exploded, as Angelo&rsquo;s story was
finished. &ldquo;That is the end!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Angelo coldly, &ldquo;no doubt of
it. And well ended, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beckoning to his companions, he walked
from the room, down the stairs and out into
the autumn morning.</p>
<p>They walked, the three of them, Florence,
Angelo and Dan Baker, one full city block.
Then Dan Baker spoke. What he said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee. Coffee and waffles, with pure
maple syrup. Right in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus spoke Dan Baker, the old trouper. He
had lost, perhaps forever, his one chance for
fame and fortune. But he had not lost his
heart of gold.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>After leaving the theatre, Merry had gone
at once to a nearby store and purchased a
spool of stout linen thread.</p>
<p>Once outside the store, she attached the end
of the thread to the silk cord on the falcon&rsquo;s
leg. The next thing she did was to shake the
falcon from her wrist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Flapping lazy wings, he soared aloft.
Scarcely had he cleared the low building before
him, however, than he shot straight away
toward the west.</p>
<p>Astonished at the pull he gave upon her
thread, and fearful lest he break it, Merry
played out the line grudgingly until she had
him stopped and then slowly drew him back.
Catching sight of her, he soared back to a
place on her wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s settled!&rdquo; she exclaimed with considerable
animation. &ldquo;I guessed as much.
Now for something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boarding a street car and ignoring the astonished
stares of those who rode with her as
they saw the falcon, she took a seat and rattled
away toward the west.</p>
<p>When she had ridden thirty blocks she left
the car, and stood again on a street corner and
released her bird.</p>
<p>The performance of half an hour before was
repeated in every detail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still westward he wings his flight,&rdquo; she
murmured as she drew the bird back. &ldquo;That
means the Forest Preserve. The flats around
the settlement house are at my back now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t go out there alone,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Not safe. They might kidnap me, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of Kay King and Weston.
Maxwell Street was not far off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll help me,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>Turning, she walked rapidly toward Maxwell
Street and Kay King&rsquo;s book store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He belongs to those gypsies,&rdquo; she said an
hour later, pointing to the falcon.</p>
<p>Kay had stood frowning and silent while
she told her story. &ldquo;Those gypsies kidnaped
Petite Jeanne,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I thought that
from the start. When I found this bird I was
sure of it. Since he flies toward the Forest
Preserve I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;s out there somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably right,&rdquo; Kay agreed. &ldquo;And
I know where they&rsquo;re camped. I bought some
old French books from them week before last.
You can&rsquo;t go there on a street car. Too far.
Weston&rsquo;s off with his truck. Went for some
trunks. When he gets back we can go out
there. I&rsquo;ll call Big John. He keeps a shop
down the street. He&rsquo;s got a gun, a regular
cannon. We might need it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Merry, as a little thrill ran
up her spine, &ldquo;we might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weston was slow in returning. Big John
with his &ldquo;regular cannon&rdquo; needed looking up.
It was mid-afternoon by the time they went
rattling off toward the Forest Preserve.</p>
<p>A strange lot of detectives they were, this
&ldquo;Golden Circle&rdquo; of Merry&rsquo;s: Kay King with
his sensitive, almost girlish face; Weston, red-faced
and habitually smiling; Big John, immense,
stoical and slow, with a large gun
tucked under his arm; and last, but not least,
Merry and her falcon.</p>
<p>The men rode on the broad front seat.
Merry brought up the rear. She was comfortably
stowed away in a pile of old quilts
and blankets that lay on the floor of the closed
truck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be almost night before we get there,&rdquo; the
girl thought to herself.</p>
<p>As she closed her eyes she seemed to see
gypsy camp fires gleaming in the fading light
of day. About one of these fires a blonde girl
was dancing. The girl was Petite Jeanne. A
strange sort of vision, but not far wrong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br />THROUGH ONE LONG NIGHT</h2>
<p>Gypsy camp fires were indeed dispelling
dark shadows of a fading day in the
heart of a forest glade when the truck bearing
Merry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Golden Circle&rdquo; arrived at the
scene of the encampment. But no little French
girl danced about any of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone, those Frenchies,&rdquo; said the
greasy gypsy who came out of a tent in answer
to their call. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know much about
&rsquo;em. They&rsquo;re not of our tribe. We&rsquo;re Americans;
been here for generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they have a girl with them?&rdquo; Weston
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yellow-haired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s with &rsquo;em, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bound?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, bound?&rdquo; The gypsy
stared. &ldquo;Gypsies don&rsquo;t tie their folks up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she was kidnaped,&rdquo; Merry broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, young lady!&rdquo; The man came close.
His air was defiant, almost threatening.
&ldquo;Gypsies don&rsquo;t kidnap girls. Why should
they? Got enough of their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment three dirty children
crowded around him. The look on his face
softened as he patted their tousled heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That girl kidnaped!&rdquo; He laughed hoarsely.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s one of &rsquo;em. Talks their French
lingo. Talks gypsy talk, too, better&rsquo;n me.
Danced all day, didn&rsquo;t she, youngsters?&rdquo;
Again he patted the dark hair of the shy children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful, so beautiful dancer!&rdquo; the oldest
girl murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; he exulted. &ldquo;I tell the truth. Children
don&rsquo;t lie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;But where have they gone?&rdquo; Merry&rsquo;s mind
was in a whirl. Petite Jeanne staying in such
a place of her own free will? Petite Jeanne,
who was so much needed elsewhere, dancing
all day beside a gypsy tent? The thing seemed
impossible. Yet here were the guileless little
children to confirm the statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! I will show you.&rdquo; The man disappeared
within the tent. He was back in half a
minute. In his hand he held a soiled road map.
On this, with some skill, he traced a route that
ended in a village called Pine Grove, many
miles away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond this place,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;is a
great pine grove. Some man planted it there
many years ago. You cannot miss it. There
is only one like this in the state. This is where
they will camp. There are others of their kind
camping there. They are gone three hours
ago in a motor van. See! There are the wheel
tracks. You may follow, but you will not overtake
them; not in that.&rdquo; He pointed at their
truck with a smile. &ldquo;Gypsies have always been
blacksmiths. Now many are motor mechanics.
They trade for cars, fix &rsquo;em up. Always
it is for a better car. By and by they have a
very fine one. So it is with these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still smiling, he bowed himself into his tent,
and closed the flap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;We may be slow,&rdquo; Weston said grimly,
&ldquo;but we are sure. We will be in Pine Grove
before sunrise. Hop in, little lady, and we&rsquo;ll
step on the gas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A motorist traveling that long and lonely
road, mapped out by the gypsy and taken by
Merry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Golden Circle&rdquo; that night, might,
had he been traveling in the opposite direction,
have marveled at the motor transports he
met that night.</p>
<p>The first was high, broad and long, a gaudily
painted house on wheels. On its seat rode
three men. At the back of this traveling house
was a room, much like the one room apartments
of a modern city. Two broad berths
let down from the ceiling were occupied; the
one on the right by a girl, the one on the left
by a woman and child.</p>
<p>The girl was Petite Jeanne. With her
golden hair all tossed about on her pillow, she
slept the sleep of innocence.</p>
<p>Do you marvel at this? Had not a gypsy
van been her home in France for many a happy
season? Ah yes, this was truly her home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>From time to time, as the van jolted over
its rough way, she half awakened and found
herself wondering dimly what beautiful
French village they might be near when they
camped for breakfast in the morning. Happily
sleep found her again ere she was sufficiently
awake to realize that she was in the
bleak interior of America; that she was with
strange gypsies, and that she had no money.</p>
<p>The woman and child across from her were
not so fortunate. The child, a girl of two or
three years, whose eyes were dark as night
and whose tangled curls were like a raven&rsquo;s
wing, tossed about in her bed. She was burning
hot with fever. The mother slept fitfully.
Often she awakened to sit up and stare with
big, motherly eyes at the child; then with tender
fingers she tucked it securely in. The
gypsy mother loves the children God has
given her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>Three hours back on this road a second
truck made its lumbering way through the
night. On its seat, taking turns at nodding
and dozing or driving, sat three men. They
were not well clothed. The night wind blew
all too frankly through their threadbare coats.
But their hearts were warm, so they cared
little for the wind.</p>
<p>At the back of this truck, buried deep in a
pile of ragged quilts and blankets, was blue-eyed
Merry. She slept the long night through.</p>
<p>With the dawn Weston swung his truck
sharply to the right, drove on for a quarter of
a mile and then brought it to a sputtering halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Merry!&rdquo; he shouted back. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
here. And over there is your friend. See!
She is dancing the sun up. She is dancing
around a gypsy camp fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there, sure enough, radiant as the morn,
was the little French girl, dancing her heart
away while a broad circle of gypsy folks admired
and applauded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what,&rdquo; Merry rubbed her eyes as she
tumbled from the truck, &ldquo;what do you think of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />THE FALLING SAND</h2>
<p>&ldquo;These people surely did kidnap me.
But, oh, for a very good reason!&rdquo;
Petite Jeanne placed her palms against one
another and held them up as a child does in
a good-night prayer.</p>
<p>Almost on the instant of their arrival, the
little French girl&rsquo;s keen eyes had recognized
the men of Merry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Golden Circle&rdquo; and had
come dancing out to meet them.</p>
<p>When Merry tumbled out at the back of the
van, Jeanne had seized her by the hand and,
without a word of explanation, dragged her
to a place beside the gypsy camp fire. After
a moment in which to regain her breath and
overcome her astonishment at the arrival of
these friends, she had seized a huge pot of
English tea and a plate of cakes and then had
dragged Merry away to the shadows of a huge
black pine tree, leaving the three men to have
breakfast with the gypsies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;And to think!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;that you should
have come all this way to find me, you and
your &lsquo;Golden Circle!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we thought you must be in great distress,&rdquo;
Merry murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you would. And that only goes
to prove that I, who have been a gypsy, have
no right to try living as those do who have
not been gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But truly I must tell you!&rdquo; Jeanne set
down her cup of tea. &ldquo;You see, these gypsies
are French. They knew I, too, was French,
that I had been a gypsy, and that I had the
God of Fire. How?&rdquo; She threw up her
hands. &ldquo;How do they know many things?
Because they are gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These people,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;believe very
much in the power of the Fire God. He is
able to heal the sick. They believe that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;They believe more than this. They think
that when one is sick he is only sad. If they
can cheer him up, then he will be well again.
So: sing to him; play the violin and guitar;
dance for him. Bring the Fire God and dance
before him. That is best of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see that beautiful child?&rdquo; she
asked suddenly. She nodded her head toward
the camp. &ldquo;The one among the blankets before
the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merry nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That child has been very, very sick. Now
we have sung for her. We have danced for
her. The Fire God is here. He has smiled for
her. Perhaps she will get well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; she concluded, as if all had been
explained, &ldquo;that is why they kidnaped me.
They knew I could dance very well. They
wished me to dance before the Fire God that
the child might be well again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice took on an appealing
quality. &ldquo;I might have escaped. After they
had taken me from the theatre, they did not
compel me to stay. But how could I come
away? There was the child. And is not one
child, even a gypsy child, more than friends or
plays or money or food, or any of these?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Merry thoughtfully, &ldquo;she is
more than all these. But why did they not ask
you to come? Why did they carry you away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! They are simple people. They did not
believe I would come willingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were at the theatre three times.
Twice they really meant to ask me, but did
not dare. The child grew worse. Then they
took me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the falcon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It escaped that night. They told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was the falcon that led us to you,&rdquo;
said Merry. It was her turn to take up the
story.</p>
<p>That day a doctor was called. He pronounced
the gypsy child out of danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said Merry, looking earnestly into
his eyes, &ldquo;did she truly help?&rdquo; She threw a
glance at Petite Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without a shadow of doubt.&rdquo; Here was an
understanding doctor. &ldquo;She helped the
mother and father to be cheerful and hopeful.
This spirit was imparted to the child. Nothing
could have helped her more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Merry, &ldquo;I am glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That afternoon the three men, who had
slept the morning through in the back of
Weston&rsquo;s truck, drove Jeanne and Merry to
the nearby village where they caught a train
to the city.</p>
<p>It was a very sober Jeanne who approached
the door of the theatre that evening just as
the shadows of skyscrapers were growing
long.</p>
<p>To her surprise she found Florence, Angelo,
Dan Baker and Swen, gathered there. At their
backs were several large trunks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! What&mdash;&rdquo; She stared from one to
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been thrown out,&rdquo; Angelo stated briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the opera? Our beautiful opera?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no opera. We have been
thrown out.&rdquo; Angelo seemed tired. &ldquo;A road
company opens here a week from next Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence saw the little French girl sway,
and caught her. As she did so, she heard her
murmur:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;The hand of Fate! It has turned the hour
glass. The sand is falling on my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was not ill, as Florence feared; only a
little faint from lack of rest and sleep. She
had once more caught a vision of that giant
hour glass. A cup of coffee from a nearby
shop revived her spirits.</p>
<p>She started to tell her story, but Angelo
stopped her. &ldquo;All in good time!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;You are too tired now. And we
must look to our trunks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must explain. I&mdash;&rdquo; The little
French girl was almost in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear child,&rdquo; said Angelo, in the gentlest of
tones, &ldquo;we are your friends. We love you.
Never explain. Your friends do not require
it; your enemies do not deserve it; you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! A very happy little party, I see.&rdquo;
A voice that none of them recognized broke in.
The short, stout, rather ugly man with a large
nose and a broad smile who had thus spoken
was a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thrown out,&rdquo; said Angelo, jerking a hand
toward the trunks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;So! That&rsquo;s bad. Winter, too.&rdquo; The man
looked them over calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little girl can dance,&rdquo; he said, nodding
at Jeanne, &ldquo;like an angel. Where&rsquo;ve I seen
her? Can&rsquo;t recall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, my friend.&rdquo; He patted Dan
Baker on the shoulder. &ldquo;Where did I see
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Topeka, Kansas.&rdquo; The old trouper smiled.
&ldquo;Or was it Joplin, Missouri?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably Joplin,&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind giving me your card?&rdquo; He turned to
Angelo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, write it here.&rdquo; He proffered a
blank page of a much-thumbed note book.</p>
<p>Angelo wrote. The stranger departed without
another word. He had said nothing of
real importance; had not so much as told them
who he was, nor how he made his living; yet
his pause there among them had inspired them
with fresh hope. Such is the buoyancy of
youth. And the old trouper was in spirit the
youngest of them all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br />A DARK DAWN</h2>
<p>Before retiring that night Florence
and Petite Jeanne sat for a long time in
their own small room, discussing the past and
future.</p>
<p>They had spent the earlier hours of the evening
in Angelo&rsquo;s studio. There, in frankness
and utter sincerity, the little company had discussed
its prospects.</p>
<p>No one blamed Petite Jeanne for the part
she had played. Being endowed with tender
and kindly souls, they one and all felt that
under the same conditions they would have
acted in an identical manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of little consequence,&rdquo; Angelo had declared
magnanimously. &ldquo;We should never
have succeeded under that management. The
opera was doomed. And once a failure always
a failure in the realm of playland.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo; Dan Baker&rsquo;s kindly
old eyes had lighted with a smile. &ldquo;You have
youth and love and beauty, all of you. How
can you ask for more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech had seemed quite wonderful at
the time. But to these girls sitting on their
bed, facing facts, the future did not seem rosy.
With only two weeks&rsquo; room rent paid, with
less than ten dollars between them, with no
income save Florence&rsquo;s meager pay, and with
bleak old winter close at hand, they could not
but dread what lay ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; Florence said at last, as if to
change the subject, &ldquo;was the gypsy who
chased you, on that morning when you fell
into Merry&rsquo;s cellar, among those you saw at
the Forest Preserve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the little French girl said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;No, I am sure he was not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said her companion, &ldquo;we had better
put his Majesty, the little God of Fire, back to
rest in his hole in the floor. You may need him
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure we shall.&rdquo; The little French girl&rsquo;s
tone carried assurance. &ldquo;That opera is beautiful,
very, very beautiful. And what is it the
poet says?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A thing of beauty is a joy forever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And still another:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;All that is at all</p>
<p class="t0">Lasts forever, past recall.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;If these things are true, how can our beautiful
opera fail to live? Believe me, our time
will yet come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, we must hide the little Fire God
very carefully indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three weeks passed. Trying weeks they
were to the little French girl; weeks in which
her faith and courage were severely tested.</p>
<p>As proof of her faith in the beautiful thing
Angelo and Swen had created, she kept up her
dancing. Sometimes in Angelo&rsquo;s studio, sometimes
in her own small room, sometimes humming
snatches of the score, sometimes with
Swen beating the battered piano, she danced
tirelessly on. There were times, too, when
those hardy souls who went to walk in the
park on these bleak days saw a golden haired
sprite dancing in the sun. This, too, was Jeanne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>But when winter came sweeping down,
when on one memorable November day she
awoke and found the window ledge piled high
with snow and heard the shriek of a wind that,
whirling and eddying outside, seemed never to
pause, she despaired a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This American winter,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;It is terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And how could it seem otherwise to her?
In her beloved France it snowed a little. But
the snow was soon gone. No drifts three feet
high, no blocked traffic, no terrible thermometer
dropping to twenty below. Besides, when
winter came in France, the gypsies, &ldquo;folding
their tents like the Arabs,&rdquo; drifted away
toward the south where it was always summer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>By drawing the covers up over her head
she was able to shut out from her eyes the
sight of the drifting snow and from her ears
the sound of the shrieking wind. But she
could not hide from her alert mind the fact
that her money was gone, that the rent was
overdue, nor that Florence&rsquo;s pitiful salary, if
such it might be called, sufficed only to supply
them with the plainest of food.</p>
<p>In these last days she had gone less seldom
to Angelo&rsquo;s studio. Matters were no better
there. And, though for her sake Angelo and
his companions kept up a continuous chatter
about future successes and good times just
around the corner, she knew in her heart that
they, too, were discouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are the traveling bags,&rdquo; she told herself
now, as she threw back the covers and
sat up. &ldquo;Those three pigskin traveling bags
down there in Angelo&rsquo;s studio. I have fifteen
dollars invested in them. Kay King has always
said: &lsquo;You may have the money back
any time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she thought soberly, &ldquo;it is wrong
of me to keep them. But to sell them seems
like betraying a friend. To cast all those beautiful
treasures, bestowed upon my good friend
by those who loved him best, before the eyes
of curious, grasping and often stupid people,
and to say &lsquo;Come, buy these,&rsquo; certainly does
seem like the betrayal of a friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;And he was so kind to me!&rdquo; She closed
her eyes and saw it all again. &ldquo;I was so
young. The ship, the sea, all the people were
so strange. And America. It, at first, was
even worse. But he, big-hearted man that he
was, treated me as his own daughter. He
made everything seem so simple, so joyous,
so much like a lark. How can I? Oh, how can
I?&rdquo; She wrung her slender hands in agony.
&ldquo;How can I permit them to be sold?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she thought more calmly, &ldquo;it
has been more than three weeks since I wrote
that letter to his hotel in New York. There
has been time for it to reach England and for
the reply to come. I have heard nothing. Perhaps
he is dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No reply,&rdquo; she thought again. &ldquo;There may
have been one, and yet I may not have known
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was true. Since she did not wish to
carry the heavy bags to her room, she had
left them at Angelo&rsquo;s studio, and in writing
the letter had given only that address.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have not been to the studio for three days.
A letter may await me. I shall go to-day. If
he reclaims the bags, he will repay me. Perhaps
there will be a tiny reward. Then all
will be well again. Ah, yes, why despair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, she hopped out of bed, did
ten minutes of shadow-dancing and then, having
hopped into her clothes, set about the
business of making toast and coffee over an
electric plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; she murmured as she sipped her coffee,
&ldquo;is after all very, very sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVI</span>
<br />THE SAINTED BEGGAR</h2>
<p>An afterthought had a tendency to dim the
little French girl&rsquo;s hopes. Angelo, she
remembered, had called her on the phone the
day before.</p>
<p>He had, he assured her, nothing of importance
to say. &ldquo;And that,&rdquo; she told herself
now, &ldquo;means no letter. And yet, he may have
forgotten. Ah, well, we&rsquo;ll hope. And I shall
not go there until evening. That will give
the mailman one more day to do his bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She called to mind the things Angelo had
told her. He and his companions were very
close to the bottom. His precious treasures,
rugs and all, must soon go. They were living
from hand to mouth. Dan Baker had been
earning a little, three or four dollars a day.
&ldquo;Doing impersonation.&rdquo; That is what the old
trouper had called it, whatever that might
mean. Swen had hopes of earning something
soon. How? He did not know. As for himself,
he had found nothing. He had even offered
to sell books on drama at a book store;
but they would not have him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sell books.&rdquo; She sat staring at the wall
now. &ldquo;Who would buy them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was thinking of blue-eyed Merry and of
her last visit to the basement shop. &ldquo;It is
hard,&rdquo; the brave little Irish girl had said to her.
&ldquo;For days and days no one has entered the
shop. And we need money so badly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we have hopes,&rdquo; she had added quickly.
&ldquo;The holiday season is coming. Perhaps those
who cannot buy costly presents will come to
our shop and buy mended ones that are cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it,&rdquo; Jeanne had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see!&rdquo; Merry had cried, pointing at the
marble falcon with the broken beak, that rested
on the shelf above her desk. &ldquo;See! He is
still looking toward the sky. All will be well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, little girl with your smiling Irish eyes,&rdquo;
Jeanne had cried, throwing both arms about
her, &ldquo;How I love you! Some day I&rsquo;ll be rich.
Then I shall give you a falcon all made of gold
and he shall be looking toward the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now as she sat alone in her room, she
thought again of the marble falcon, and murmured,
&ldquo;I wonder if the falcon told the truth.
I wonder if all will be well? Truly, in such
times as these it is necessary to have great
faith if one is to be brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw herself into her dances that day
with abandon. By the time she had done the
last wild whirl she had worked herself up to
such heights that she felt sure that a change
for the better would come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as if I were preparing for some great
event,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;a trial of my skill
that will mean great success or terrible defeat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as she went toward the studio she was
given a shock that came near to breaking her
poor little heart.</p>
<p>She had rounded a corner when a sudden
rush of wind seized her and all but threw her
against a beggar who, tin cup in hand, stood
against the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>The sight of the beggar caused her to halt.
There was, she remembered, a dime in her side
coat pocket.</p>
<p>She looked again at the beggar, then thrust
her hand deep for the dime. The beggar
seemed pitifully, hopelessly forlorn. His battered
hat was drooping with snow. His long
gray hair was powdered with it. The hand
that held the cup was blue with cold. In a
sad and forlorn world he seemed the saddest
and most forlorn being of all.</p>
<p>She had the dime between her fingers and
was about to draw it forth when another look
at the old man made her start. A second look
was needed before she could be convinced that
her eyes had not deceived her. Then, with a
sound in her throat suspiciously like a sob,
she dropped the dime back in her pocket and
hastened away on the wings of the wind, as
if she had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impersonations,&rdquo; she whispered to herself,
as a chill shook her from head to foot. &ldquo;Impersonation.
He called it that. He would do even
this for his friends!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>The beggar standing there in the storm was
none other than Dan Baker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call Kay King,&rdquo; she said to herself, with
another shudder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call him to-night. I&rsquo;ll
tell him he may have those bags. And when
he brings me the money I shall give it to Dan
Baker. And he must accept it, every dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She found Angelo at the studio when she arrived.
No one else was there. Swen, he explained,
had gone out on some sort of work.
Dan Baker was doing his &ldquo;impersonations.&rdquo;
Again Jeanne shuddered at that word.</p>
<p>Angelo had greeted her with the warm affection
characteristic of his race. Now he led
her to a place beside the fire.</p>
<p>After that neither seemed to find words for
small talk. Each was busy with thoughts that
could not well be expressed. Angelo, too,
hailed from a warm and sunny clime. This
wild storm, ushering in winter so early in the
year, had sobered his usually buoyant soul.</p>
<p>After a time she asked him about the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A letter?&rdquo; he asked, seeming puzzled. &ldquo;Did
you expect a letter to come here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I did not tell you.&rdquo; She nodded
toward the corner where the three pigskin
bags stood. &ldquo;When I wrote the letter to my
friend, I gave him this address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Well, there has been no letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she said dully, &ldquo;that I may as
well turn the bags back to Kay King and get
the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you?&rdquo; He looked at her sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I must. I&rsquo;ll call him on the phone
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could put this plan into execution,
Swen came bursting into the room. He
wore no cap. His hair was filled with snow.
His face was red with the cold. But his spirits
were buoyant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had a whale of a time,&rdquo; he shouted boisterously.
&ldquo;And see! I have three whole dollars!
To-night we feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne heaved a sigh of relief. There
was money in the house. Now she need not
call Kay King, at least not until morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A day of grace,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>It was some time later that, chancing to
catch a glimpse of the talented young musician&rsquo;s
hand, she saw with a shock that they
were covered with blisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been shoveling snow in the street,&rdquo;
she told herself. An added ache came to her
overburdened heart.</p>
<p>Dan Baker came in a moment later. Beating
the snow from his hat, he threw it into a
corner. Having shaken the snow from his hair,
he advanced to greet Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know I saw him,&rdquo; she thought,
as she looked straight into his transparent blue
eyes. &ldquo;I am so glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first he seemed too tired for talk. Taking
a place before the fire, he appeared to fall into
a dreamy reverie.</p>
<p>At last, rousing himself, he drew from his
pocket a coin that shone in the dim light. It
was a gold piece, one of those rare two-dollar-and-a-half
pieces. Jeanne started at the sight
of it. How had he come by it? Had some one,
mistaking it for a penny, dropped it in his cup?</p>
<p>Still looking at the coin, Dan Baker spoke
one word: &ldquo;Gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>His weary old eyes took on an unwonted
brightness. &ldquo;That reminds me. Once I was
down on my luck as an actor. That was in
Colorado.&rdquo; He paused and his eyes appeared
to grow misty with recollection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s off again,&rdquo; Jeanne told herself. &ldquo;But
how wonderful!&rdquo; Her eyes grew dim with
tears. &ldquo;How marvelous to be able to forget
all that is sordid, cold and mean, all the heartaches
of the present in one&rsquo;s dreams of an unreal
but charming past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was about to say,&rdquo; Dan Baker made
a fresh start, &ldquo;I was no longer an actor. No
one wished me to act. So, securing pick, a pan
and a burro&mdash;or was it two burros?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Petite Jeanne. &ldquo;Just as
you were to do in our play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as he <i>is</i> to do,&rdquo; Angelo corrected
stoutly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Dan Baker broke in, like a child
whose story has been interrupted. &ldquo;But the
burros. There were two, I am sure. Well, I
recall the jingle of picks and shovels, pots and
pans as we traveled up Bear Creek Canyon in
Colorado&mdash;beautiful, wonderful Colorado,
where the snow-capped mountains are reflected
in tiny lakes whose waters are blue-black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three days we traveled. Three nights I
slept by a burned out camp fire on the banks
of a madly rushing stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From time to time I caught the gleam of
a golden speck in the sand at the river&rsquo;s bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the gold,&rdquo; I told myself, &ldquo;is higher up.
And so it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to poke at the fire. As his eyes
reflected the gleam of the fire the little French
girl knew that he was not in the heart of a
great, sordid and selfish city, but far, far away,
prodding a camp fire in beautiful Colorado
where snow-capped mountains are reflected in
tiny lakes whose waters are a deep blue-black.
And she was glad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold,&rdquo; he began once more. &ldquo;Ah, yes.
There was gold. You would be surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I built a cabin, all of logs save the floor.
That was of fragrant fir and spruce boughs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;One day as I panned the sand I came upon
a brownish object that seemed to be an ancient
copper kettle turned upside down and half
buried in the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;A relic of the past. Some
Forty-niner must have passed this way and
left his kettle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I struck it lightly with the side of my pick.
Naturally I expected it to give off a hollow
sound. No hollow sound came; only a dull
thud, as if I had struck a rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instantly my heart beat wildly. I had made
a great discovery&mdash;how great I could only
guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quickly I drew my sheath knife. Using
this as a chisel, and a stone as a hammer, I cut
off a chip of this yellow boulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine my joy when it came off gleaming
like yellow fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gold!&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;A boulder of pure gold!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I fell suddenly silent. What if some
one had heard me?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to pry the boulder from the sand.
It would not budge. Gold is heavy. Do you
know how heavy?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Darkness was falling. The curtain of night
would hide my treasure. I returned to my
cabin, fried a supply of bacon, baked corn-cakes
over hot coals, and enjoyed a regal repast.
And why not? Was I not rich as any
king?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the beloved wanderer prodded
the fire. As he did so a dramatic look of gray
despair overspread his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I slept well that night. Awakened sometime
before dawn by the dull roar of thunder,
I looked out on a world of inky blackness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Going to rain,&rsquo; I thought. Then I crawled
back between the blankets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for long. To the occasional roar of
thunder was added a more terrifying sound.
An endless, ever increasing roar came echoing
down the canyon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowing its meaning, I wrenched my cabin
door from its hinges, and then awaited the
worst.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had not long to wait. As if by magic I
felt my door, my life saving raft, lifted beneath
me by a raging torrent and go spinning round
and round. We were on our way, riding the
flood of a cloudburst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; He paused to reflect. &ldquo;I landed
in a fellow&rsquo;s cornfield. He wanted to charge
me for the corn my raft broke down. I
wouldn&rsquo;t stand for that, so I went down to
Denver and joined a troupe that was playing
<i>Ten Nights in a Bar Room</i>. For a man that
never drank, I claim I had a pretty good line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that gold?&rdquo; put in Swen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! The gold? Sure. Yes, the gold!&rdquo; For
a moment the old man seemed bewildered.
Then a bright smile lighted his wrinkled face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold, my son, is heavy. That flood moved
half the mountainside. And when it was over,
where was my golden boulder? At the bottom
of it all, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That story,&rdquo; said Petite Jeanne, &ldquo;sounds almost
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True?&rdquo; He beamed on her his old, gracious
smile. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s true. At least, I did
once play a part in <i>Ten Nights in a Bar Room</i>&mdash;a
mighty fine line, too, for a man who never
drank a quart of whisky in his whole life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>After that, Dan Baker sat for a time staring
at the glittering bit of gold, the smallest
coin of our realm. When he spoke again it
was to the coin alone. &ldquo;You came to me by
chance. What for? To buy stale bread, and
butter made from cocoanut oil, and a soup
bone? Tell me. Shall it be this, or shall it be
sirloin steak, a pie and a big pot of coffee with
real cream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Petite Jeanne looked and listened, she
seemed to see him once again, standing half
buried in snow, a tin cup frozen to his benumbed
fingers. She was about to speak, to
utter words of wise counsel, when with a suddenness
that caused them all to start, there
came a loud knock at the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVII</span>
<br />&ldquo;THIS IS OUR GOLDEN HOUR&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The unexpected visitor was a short, stout
man with a large hooked nose. So completely
engulfed was he in a great raccoon
coat, that on first sight not one of them recognized
him. When, however, he had removed
that coat he was known at a glance. It was
none other than the rather ugly, fat Jew who
had taken Angelo&rsquo;s name and address on that
dismal day when they stood with their trunks
before the old Blackmoore theatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, ho!&rdquo; he exclaimed. Just as, Jeanne
thought, a bear might should he enter a cave
filled with rabbits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine place here.&rdquo; He advanced toward the
fire. &ldquo;All very cheerful. Delightful company.
May I sit down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for an answer, he took a
chair by the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>An awkward silence followed. Petite Jeanne
wiggled her bare toes; she had danced a little
that evening. Swen pawed his blonde mane.
Dan Baker stared dreamily into the fire.</p>
<p>The stranger&rsquo;s eyes wandered from one to
the other of them. They rested longest on
Petite Jeanne. This made her uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; said the stranger, crashing the
silence and indulging in a broad grin that completely
transformed his face, &ldquo;is Abraham Solomon.
You&rsquo;d say my parents left nothing to
the imagination when they named me, now
wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He laughed uproariously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they didn&rsquo;t. And neither do I. Never
have. Never will. What I want to know is,
have you placed that light opera?&rdquo; He turned
an enquiring eye on Angelo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, er&mdash;&rdquo; the Italian youth stammered,
&ldquo;we&mdash;we haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Solomon, &ldquo;suppose you show
it to me now.&rdquo; He nodded toward the miniature
stage at the back of the studio. &ldquo;That is,
as much of it as you can&mdash;first act at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;On your toes!&rdquo; Angelo smiled as his
friends leaped from their places by the fire.
Not one of them could guess what it meant.
But, like Petite Jeanne, they believed more or
less in fairies, goblins, and Santa Claus.</p>
<p>The performance they put on that night for
the benefit of their audience of one, who sat
like a Sphinx with his back to the fire, would
have done credit to a broader stage.</p>
<p>When they had finished, the look on the
stranger&rsquo;s face had not changed.</p>
<p>Rising suddenly from his chair, he seemed
about to depart without a word.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne could have wept. She had
hoped&mdash;what had she not hoped? And now&mdash;</p>
<p>But no. The man turned to Angelo. &ldquo;Got
a phone here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder.&rdquo; Angelo pointed a trembling finger
toward the corner. There was a strange
glow on his face. Perhaps he read character
better than Jeanne.</p>
<p>They heard Solomon call a number. Then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Mister Mackenzie? Solomon
speaking. Is the Junior Ballet there?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Spare &rsquo;em for an hour? In costume? Put
on their fur coats and send &rsquo;em over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this number?&rdquo; He whirled about
to ask Angelo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six&mdash;six&mdash;eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six&mdash;six&mdash;eight on the boulevard. Send
&rsquo;em in taxis. I&rsquo;ll meet &rsquo;em at the sidewalk and
pay the fares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen minutes? Great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word he drew on his great coat
and, slamming the door behind him, went
thumping down the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what&mdash;&rdquo; Jeanne was too astonished
for speech.</p>
<p>Angelo seized her hand. He drew their
friends into the circle and pulled them into a
wild roundo-rosa about the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re made!&rdquo; he exclaimed as, out of
breath, he released them. &ldquo;Abraham Solomon
is the greatest genius of a manager and producer
the world has ever known.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the Junior Ballet! Oh, la la! You
never have seen so many natural beauties before,
and never will again. They are in training
for Grand Opera. So you see they must
be most beautiful and good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; he cried, almost in dismay,
&ldquo;they will be here, here in my studio in fifteen
minutes! Every one of you give me a hand.
Let&rsquo;s put it in order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she assisted in the re-arranging of the
studio, Petite Jeanne found her head all
awhirl. Half an hour before she had listened
with a pain in her heart to Dan Baker discussing
dry bread or a full meal over a small gold
piece he had gained by begging in the snow.
And now all this. How could she stand it?
She wanted to run away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must not,&rdquo; she told herself stoutly.
&ldquo;I must not! For this is our golden hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had she regained her composure
when there came the sound of many pairs of
feet ascending the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They come,&rdquo; Angelo whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my good Father of Love!&rdquo; Petite
Jeanne murmured faintly. &ldquo;Is it for this that
I have danced so long?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo; In the girl&rsquo;s eyes was a prayer.
&ldquo;Then, good Father, give me courage for one
short hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later Angelo and Swen were assisting
in the removal of fur coats from visions
of loveliness that surpassed the most gorgeous
butterflies. For this, you must know, was the
Junior Ballet of the Grand Opera. Selected for
beauty and grace, they would have shone in
any ballroom of the land.</p>
<p>Some were slender, some plump. There were
black eyes, brown and blue. There were heads
of black, brown and golden hue. The costumes,
too, were varied. All were of the filmiest
of fabrics and all were gorgeous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; exclaimed the miracle-working Solomon,
spreading his hands wide. &ldquo;I have
brought these here that I may see you dancing
with them. I wish to know how you fit in;
how you will appear before them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, poor me!&rdquo; The little French girl covered
her face. &ldquo;Who am I that I should dance
before these so beautiful ones?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said the fairy godfather who had
suddenly arrived in their midst. &ldquo;It is for you
only to do your dances as I have seen you here.
Yes, and I once did over in the old Blackmoore.
Ah, yes, I was a spy. I saw you dance,
and how very well you did it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne wondered with a thrill whether he
could have bribed some one to admit him to
the theatre on one of those nights when she
danced to the God of Fire alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us see.&rdquo; Solomon allowed his glance
to fall upon the circle of dancers. &ldquo;Perhaps
we can find something you all know. Then
you can do it together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He named one well known dance after another;
this one from light opera and that from
grand opera, without success until he came to
the polka from <i>The Bartered Bride</i>.</p>
<p>At once all eyes shone. Even Dan Baker
was prepared to do his part, and Swen to have
a try at the music.</p>
<p>Never was the beautiful dance performed in
such unusual surroundings. And seldom has
it been done so well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>When the last graceful swing was executed,
when whirling gowns were still, and the company
had gathered in a circle before the fire
with the girls reposing in colorful groups on
his beloved rugs, and the men standing about,
Angelo caught a long breath, and murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Solomon in a voice that trembled
slightly, &ldquo;is a great moment. The best, in
a great profession, I have met. The result is
beauty beyond compare, and a light opera that
will outshine the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the playhouse.&rdquo; Angelo strove to bring
him down to earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house? The most beautiful in the city.
Where else? The Civic Theatre. You know
the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know it?&rdquo; How well he knew that place
of beauty, that palace of gold and old rose!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but you forget,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;It
is only for occasional things; recitals, Shakespeare,
the very unusual affairs!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; said Solomon, clapping him on
the back, &ldquo;This, my boy, will be the most unusual
of all! We may remain as long as we
are good. And we shall be good forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I promised to bring these ladies back
promptly.&rdquo; He sprang into action. &ldquo;Come!
Coats on! And let&rsquo;s be away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the ladies of the Junior Ballet were
rushed into coats and fairly pushed down the
stairs to waiting taxis, not one of them failed
to pause and give Jeanne a hug and a smile or
a whispered word of congratulation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How different!&rdquo; she thought as a great
lump came into her throat. &ldquo;How very different
from Eve and her circle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Solomon turned from hurrying the
girls away. &ldquo;This will act as a binder. Be here
to-morrow at nine.&rdquo; He thrust something into
Angelo&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Angelo opened his hand after a time and
spread out five fifty dollar bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One for you, and you, and you, and you,&rdquo;
he chanted as he dealt them out, finally cramming
one into his own pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he invited. &ldquo;This is an hour for
silent thanksgiving.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;And prayer,&rdquo; the devout French girl murmured
softly.</p>
<p>They had been sitting thus in absolute silence
for some time when, with a rush that
brought in a wave of cold air, Florence burst
into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Florence! My own!&rdquo; Jeanne cried,
throwing herself into the big girl&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;To-night
fairies and angels and godfathers have
been here and for you and me the world begins
once more to roll round and round just
as it used to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady there!&rdquo; said Angelo soberly. &ldquo;We
have another opportunity to make good. That
is all. We must all do our very best. We must
guard our steps well. Then, perhaps, all our
dreams will come true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, a sober but joyous company,
they parted for the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>As Jeanne left the room she allowed her eyes
to stray to the corner where rested the three
traveling bags. She heaved a great sigh of relief
and crowded her life saving fifty dollar bill
deeper into her small purse. She had not been
obliged to sell the treasures of a friend, and
for this she was more thankful than for her
own good fortune.</p>
<p>But would this friend ever come for his
property? She wondered.</p>
<p>As they made their way through the driving
snow to the street car Florence thought she
caught a glimpse of a dark, bulky figure following
in the shadows. Seizing Petite Jeanne
by the arm she hurried along.</p>
<p>A car came rolling up on the padded snow
just as they arrived. Soon they were stowed
away in its warm depths. Not, however, until
Florence had noted that the bulky figure was
a large man in a green overcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lost him,&rdquo; she thought with some satisfaction.</p>
<p>She was wrong. As they rose to leave the
car she saw, seated at the back, that same man.
She knew in an instant who he was. For ten
seconds her brain whirled. She was obliged
to grip the edge of a seat for support.</p>
<p>Regaining control of herself she passed out
without so much as glancing in his direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>To her surprise the man did not follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May not have recognized us.&rdquo; This was
more a wish than a hope.</p>
<p>Hurrying across the street they mounted to
their room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-m! How cozy!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
not put the light on for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping to the window, she saw the car
stop at the next crossing. A man got off.</p>
<p>Turning, he walked back in the direction in
which he had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will ring our bell,&rdquo; she told herself in
a small panic. &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did not ring. After a tremulous ten
minutes of waiting, she whispered to herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came back for our street number. That&rsquo;s
bad. Angelo was right. The fight of Maxwell
Street is not our fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the green overcoat was the one
who had started the riot on Maxwell Street
by nearly running Jeanne down in his big car,
and who had come to grief later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be long in knowing the last of that!&rdquo;
she told herself, and she was right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVIII</span>
<br />A QUEEN FROM ANOTHER WORLD</h2>
<p>No fairy princess, waving magic wand,
could have wrought a more perfect
change than came over Petite Jeanne and her
beloved companions after that hour which the
rather ugly Jew with the soul of an Abraham,
a Moses and a David all wrapped in one, spent
in their studio. It was by this man that they
were guided out of the wilderness of doubt and
despair into the land of joy and hope. By him,
too, they were, on the very next morning, ushered
into the most magnificent little theatre
Jeanne&rsquo;s glowing eyes had ever looked upon.</p>
<p>Unlike the Old Blackmoore, it was new. Its
bright colors shone gayly forth. Its seats of
velvet, its curtains of heavy velour and all its
trimmings were perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo; Jeanne exclaimed, as Solomon
threw open the door revealing it all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she sighed after a time, &ldquo;poor,
shabby old Blackmoore! I did so want to
hear its walls ring once more with laughter
and applause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed the good Solomon.
&ldquo;When a place is full of rats it should be torn
down. Why do people live in such places&mdash;work
in them, play in them? Is it not because
they themselves are slow, stupid, without the
will to tear themselves away from it all?</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; he added quickly, &ldquo;here is
your grand opportunity. Make the most of it,
my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. That I will. Yes! Yes! Yes! A
thousand, million times, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And did she? Never had there been a time
in her whole life when she worked so hard as
on the days that followed. No director with a
gray steel face was here; no brass rail where
she must twist her toes in agony; no Eve,
lacking in imagination, endeavoring to teach
where she herself should be taught. Yet there
were compelling forces driving her on. Love,
friendship, hope, the determination to win;
these are the great, beautiful masters that ever
lead us on to nobler and stronger lives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>Success was not assured. Far from that. The
Junior Ballet was, after all, little more than an
advanced class in a great school. Chosen from
the best of young dancers, they were constantly
in training so that in some dim, distant time
they might perhaps take their place by ones,
twos and threes in the ballet of some great opera
company. Beautiful they were, to be sure.
Grace was theirs, too. But seasoned troupers
they were not. For this reason there would
not be the snap and precision in their dancing
that could be found in a modern chorus.
Would youth and natural beauty replace this?
Even Solomon wrinkled his brow when the
question was asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will!&rdquo; Jeanne clenched her hands
hard. &ldquo;They must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was her great opportunity. Still more
important, it was Dan Baker&rsquo;s opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have youth. I have time to win success,&rdquo;
she assured herself. &ldquo;But for him it is now.
Now, or not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>Whenever she thought of this she threw herself
with renewed zest into her work.</p>
<p>The light opera, too, was found to be crude
and unfinished in spots. What opera is not?
Solomon suggested changes. They were made.</p>
<p>Then one day, after they had been working
for a week, a beautiful creature entered from
another world. She came sauntering down a
narrow corridor which Jeanne had seen leading
away from the left side of the stage but
had never dared to follow.</p>
<p>This creature was a woman. Jeanne knew
from her manner that she was no longer in her
twenties; yet her beautiful face did not show
it. Like Jeanne, she was fair with golden hair.
She wore, draped over her shoulders, a cape
of royal purple trimmed with white fox. Beneath
the cape showed a curious costume.
Made of some soft cloth, it appeared to belong
to another age, for it was neither the costume
of man nor woman. There was a suggestion
of a dress that might, after all, be a long coat.
And there were trousers fitting like stockings,
and curious, bright colored shoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>With no apology for her strange make-up,
she shook hands with Solomon and went to
sit with him at the back of the theatre. As
the rehearsal progressed she turned from time
to time and whispered in the producer&rsquo;s ear.
He listened attentively, nodded, or shook his
head and scribbled in his note book.</p>
<p>When it was over the mysterious one made
her way to the corridor whence she had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was she?&rdquo; Jeanne asked in an awed
whisper. Something in Solomon&rsquo;s manner suggested
that he might have come from a visit
with a queen. And so he had&mdash;a queen of her
own beautiful realm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, his eyes twinkling merrily,
&ldquo;that was our Marjory&mdash;Marjory Bryce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mar&mdash;Marjory Bryce!&rdquo; Jeanne took a step
backward. She knew that name. It belonged
to the queen of grand opera, known to the
great city as Our Marjory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did she come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where but from the Opera House?&rdquo; He
waved a hand at the corridor where the lady
from musical fairyland had vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is Grand Opera over there?&rdquo; Jeanne looked
her incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not know? Come!&rdquo; He took her
hand and led her down that corridor to its
end. There he opened a door into a world unknown,
a world that in the days to follow was
to become a veritable fairyland of beauty,
romance and adventure. It was a vast auditorium,
much the same as the Civic Theatre,
though many times larger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is the home of Grand Opera!&rdquo; The
place was deserted. Jeanne went whirling
away across its vast stage in a wild dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; she cried, clasping her hands
like a child asking for a doll, &ldquo;may I dance
here before all the people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time alone will tell,&rdquo; said Solomon soberly.
&ldquo;Art is long. First comes the Civic Theatre.
And that is task enough for the present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by the way!&rdquo; His eyes brightened.
&ldquo;Miss Bryce gave me many valuable suggestions
regarding our opera. She is one of the
greatest living authorities. No one can play
such varied roles as she. With these suggestions,
faithfully worked out, we should succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>He led the way back to the Civic Theatre.
There Florence awaited Jeanne.</p>
<p>In her dreams that night the little French
girl danced upon a stage as long as a city street
and strewn with flowers, while an audience of
millions screamed their approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she told herself as she sat up, rubbing
her eyes, &ldquo;was a strange dream. Of
course it will never come true. All the same,
in our little theatre, surrounded by my own
beloved Golden Circle&mdash;ah, well, we shall see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIX</span>
<br />A SHADOW FALLS</h2>
<p>Her glorious Golden Circle; this is what
the fellow members of her cast were
coming to be. How different was the atmosphere
of this new setting from that of the old
Blackmoore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she whispered charitably, &ldquo;the
Blackmoore was a horrible shell of a place.
And it is easier to be happy and kind in beautiful
surroundings. And yet I am sure that some
of the most wonderful circles of friendship are
found in the west side tenement region.&rdquo; She
was thinking of the blue-eyed Merry&rsquo;s Golden
Circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely their lot is hard enough,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;And yet they are happy in their own
little circles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a sad place this grim old city would
be,&rdquo; she philosophized, &ldquo;if it were not for the
thousands upon thousands of these little golden
circles of friendship we find everywhere!
Sometimes it is a group that meets periodically
in a pool room or a drug store. There are tiny
club rooms everywhere. The people who work
long days in downtown stores call one another
Mary, Bob and Tom. They, too, are happy as
they feel their tiny golden circle bind them
round and round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not one of them all,&rdquo; she exclaimed
loyally, &ldquo;can boast of a more wonderful circle
than ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of the Junior Ballet, those
beautiful, talented young women who were being
trained as her chorus. Their caresses and
words of encouragement on that first night
were not flattery. Every day, by little acts of
kindness and courtesy, they proved this. They
also bestowed their affections upon the old
trouper, Dan Baker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how I love them for that!&rdquo; the little
French girl said fervently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, who would not love him? His
gray hair, his brooding blue eyes, his gentle,
kindly manner toward all; how could anyone
resist them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon enough she was to learn that there
were those who could resist the old trouper&rsquo;s
kindly good nature. She was to learn, too, that
this gentle old man held within his heart the
courage of a soldier, the will and the power, if
need be, to become a martyr for the right.</p>
<p>It was on that very evening that, as they
loafed and talked over tea and toast in the
studio, Dan Baker was called to the telephone,
and Petite Jeanne heard him use language that
she had believed quite foreign to his tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she heard him say. &ldquo;A fund
for actors? I have subscribed to the Fund for
Aged Actors, yes. Yes. What&rsquo;s that? Another
fund? Five hundred dollars? Impossible!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will!&rdquo; She saw his face turn red. His
hands twisted themselves into livid knots.
&ldquo;Say, you! I know who you are now. It&rsquo;s a
racket! You&rsquo;re trying to shake me down.
You&rsquo;ll never do it! Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>He slammed the receiver down on the hook
and stood there until the hot blood drained
from his face and left him white as marble.
Watching him, Jeanne saw him totter. Thinking
he was about to fall she hurried up to encircle
him with her slender arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, old trouper?&rdquo; she asked gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t lie to me,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;One
has no need to lie to a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, if you must have it.&rdquo; On his
face a curious smile formed itself. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
racket been going on in this town for a long
time. My old friend Barney Bobson told me
about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, leading her back
to the fire, &ldquo;most actors are nervous, temperamental
people. They can&rsquo;t stand suspense,
lurking danger and all that. These crooks,
knowing that, have taken to demanding sums
of money for what they term a good cause:
The Actors&rsquo; Benefit. They are the only actors
benefited, and they are not actors at all, but
deep-dyed villains. They have reaped a harvest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;But here&mdash;&rdquo; He threw back his shock of
gray hair. &ldquo;Here is one golden harvest that
will never be reaped. I&rsquo;d rather die. I&rsquo;m an
old man. What&rsquo;s a year more or less? How
wonderful to go out like a candle; providing
you go for a good cause!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jeanne looked at him it seemed to her
that his face was lit with a strange glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will they do?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;And
why do they come to you before the opera has
gone on the stage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They know we have had some advances;
can perhaps get others. The opera may be a
failure; at least that&rsquo;s what they think. Now
is the time to strike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you continue to refuse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may meet them on a dark night. Or&mdash;&rdquo;
His face turned gray. &ldquo;Or they may kidnap
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kidnap me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes villains work through our
friends to undo their victims,&rdquo; he replied
wearily. &ldquo;You must be very careful. Never
go out on the street without your capable
Florence. And never walk when you can use
a cab. So, I think you will be safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he exclaimed, noting the wrinkles
in her brow. &ldquo;I have got you worrying. Do
not think of it again. Those men are cowards.
All evil doers are. We will not hear from them
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Dear old trouper,&rdquo; Jeanne said in
the gentlest of tones, &ldquo;I was not thinking of
myself, but of you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; she added a moment later, &ldquo;I
shall be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence, in her big-hearted way, had given
up her work at the settlement house and, casting
her lot with the others, had once more become
the little French girl&rsquo;s stage &ldquo;mother&rdquo;
and protector. She also became the guardian
of his Majesty the God of Fire. And it seemed
to her that he was quite as much in need of
mothering as his youthful possessor. For was
there not a dark-faced gypsy lurking, as she
sometimes imagined, in every dark corner,
ready at any moment to spring upon her and
snatch her strange treasure away?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>She had fitted up a Boston bag with a chain,
ending in a lock, run through the leather and
clamping the top tight. This she carried when
the ancient God of Fire, in pursuance of his
art as a silent actor, was obliged to make his
way from their room to the theatre and back
again. At all other times his Highness continued
to remain in hiding in the hole beneath
the floor of the room.</p>
<p>At times Florence thought of the red-faced
man, their chance enemy of Maxwell Street,
the one who on that stormy night had apparently
ridden half way across the city in order
to take down their street address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s planning some meanness,&rdquo; she assured
herself. &ldquo;What it will be only time can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Petite Jeanne told her of the threat
made to the old trouper over the telephone,
she redoubled her vigil. They traveled only in
taxicabs, and kept a sharp watch on every occasion.
One other change was made by the
stout young guardian. Whenever the gypsy
god went with them she carried beneath her
arm a rather heavy, paper-bound package,
whose contents were her secret.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXX</span>
<br />TILTING FLOORS</h2>
<p>The Grand Opera house became a veritable
fairyland of adventure for Petite
Jeanne. In this place and in her own little
theatre she felt herself to be in a place of refuge.
There were guards about. Entrance to
the place was only to be gained through long,
tortuous ways of red tape and diplomacy. No
dark-faced gypsy, no would-be kidnaper could
enter here. Thus she reasoned and sighed
with content. Was she right? We shall see.</p>
<p>One afternoon, when a brief rehearsal of
some small parts was over, not expecting
Florence for a half hour or more, she gathered
up her possession, her precious God of Fire,
and tripping down the hallway arrived before
the door that led to the land of magic, the
great stage of the Opera.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>Several times she had made her way shyly
down this hall to open the door and peer into
the promised land beyond. She had found it
to be a place of magnificent transformations.
Now it was a garden, now a castle, now a village
green, and now, reverting to form, it was
but a vast empty stage with a smooth board
floor.</p>
<p>It was on this day only a broad space. Not a
chair, not a shred of scenery graced the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How vast it is!&rdquo; she whispered, as she
looked in. She had been told that this stage
would hold fifteen hundred people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a place to dance all alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The notion tickled her fancy. There was no
one about. Slipping silently through the door,
she removed her shoes; then, with the god still
under her arm, she went tripping away to the
front center of the stage. There, having placed
her god in position, she drew a long breath
and began to dance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>It was a delicate bit of a fantastic dance she
was doing. As she danced on, with the dark
seats gaping at her, the place seemed to come
to life. Every seat was filled. The place was
deathly silent. She was nearing the end of her
dance. One moment more&mdash;and what then?
The thunder of applause?</p>
<p>So real had this bit of fancy become to her
that she clasped her hand to her heart in wild
exultation.</p>
<p>But suddenly for a fraction of time that racing
heart stood still. Something terrible was
happening. She all but lost her balance, spun
round, grew suddenly dizzy and barely escaped
falling. The end of a large section of the
floor, had risen a foot above the level of the
stage! It was still rising.</p>
<p>Her mind in a whirl, she sprang from the
tilting floor to the level space just beyond.</p>
<p>But horror of horrors! This also began to
tilt at a rakish angle. At the same time she
realized in consternation that the Fire God
was in danger of gliding down the section on
which he rested and falling into the pit of inky
blackness below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>Risking her own neck, she sprang back to
her former position, seized the god and went
dashing away across section after section of
madly rocking floors, to tumble at last into
some one&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>This someone was beyond the door in the
hallway. Realizing dimly that only the stage
floor and not the whole building was doing an
earthquake act, she gripped her breast to still
the wild beating of her heart and then looked
into the face of her protector. Instantly her
heart renewed its racing. The woman who
held her tightly clasped was none other than
the one who, in a cape of royal purple and
white fox, had sat beside Solomon and witnessed
their rehearsal&mdash;Marjory Bryce, the
greatest prima donna the city had ever known.
And she was laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please forgive me!&rdquo; she said after her mirth
had subsided. &ldquo;You looked so much like Liza
crossing the ice with the child in her arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but what&mdash;&rdquo; The little French dancer
was still confused and bewildered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand, child?&rdquo; The prima
donna&rsquo;s tone was soft and kindly as a mother&rsquo;s.
Petite Jeanne loved her for it. &ldquo;The floor is
laid in sections. Each section may be raised or
lowered by lifts beneath it. That is for making
lakes, mountains, great stairways and many
other things. Just now they are making a
mountain; just for me. To-night I sing.
Would you like to watch them? Have you
time? It is really quite fascinating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come. Let us sit right here.&rdquo; She
drew a narrow bench from a hidden recess.
&ldquo;This section will not be lifted. We may remain
here in safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an incredibly short time they saw the
stage transformed into a giant stairway. After
that, from somewhere far above the stage,
dangling from ropes, various bits of scenery
drifted down. Seized by workmen, these bits
were fitted into their places and&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold! Here is magic for you!&rdquo; exclaimed
the prima donna. &ldquo;Here we have a mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Petite Jeanne moved to the front of the
stage she found herself facing a mountainside
with slopes of refreshing green. A winding
path led toward its summit. At the top of the
path were the stone steps of a palace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said her enchantress, &ldquo;Come to the
castle steps and rest with me for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jeanne followed her up the winding path
she felt that she truly must be in fairyland.
&ldquo;And with such a guide!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the prima donna, drawing her
down to a place beside herself, &ldquo;we may sit
here and tell secrets, or fortunes, or what
would you like?&rdquo; She laughed a merry laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said as her mood
changed, &ldquo;you are really very like me in many
ways? I sing in parts you might take without
a make-up. I, who am very old,&rdquo; she laughed
once more, &ldquo;I must be made up for them very
much indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, surely not!&rdquo; the little French dancer
exclaimed. &ldquo;You are very young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, little girl.&rdquo; The prima donna
placed a hand upon her knee. &ldquo;None of us
wish to grow old. We would remain young
forever and ever in this bright, beautiful and
melodious world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you dancing here this afternoon,&rdquo;
she went on after a moment&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>Jeanne started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it very terrible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. It was beautiful, exquisite!&rdquo; The
prima donna&rsquo;s eyes shone with a frank truthfulness.
Jeanne could not doubt. It made her
feel all hot and cold inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to dance before all that?&rdquo;
The smiling woman spread her arms wide.
&ldquo;All those seats filled with people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; Jeanne caught her breath sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is really quite simple,&rdquo; the lady went on.
&ldquo;You look up at the people, then you look back
at the stage and at the ones who are to act or
sing with you. Then you say: &lsquo;I have only to
do it all quite naturally, as if they, the people
in the seats, were not there at all. If I do that
they will be pleased. And when I succeed in
doing that, they like me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think you&rsquo;d enjoy it,&rdquo; she went on
musingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; but&mdash;but not yet,&rdquo; the little girl
cried. &ldquo;Sometime in the dreamy future. Now
I want my own stage in my own sweet little
theatre, and I want to be with just my own
little Golden Circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave girl!&rdquo; The prima donna seized her
hand and squeezed it tight. &ldquo;You are indeed
wise for your years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said &lsquo;with my own little Golden
Circle.&rsquo; What is this circle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne explained as best she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said her illustrious friend, &ldquo;you
have discovered a great truth. You know the
secret of happiness. Or do you? What is it
that makes us happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing things for others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is but half of it! You know the
rest, but you do not tell me. The other part
is to allow others to do things for you. Doing
things for others and refusing to accept benefits
in return is the most selfish unselfishness
the world knows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but your Golden Circle! What a beautiful
name!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she demanded quite suddenly,
after a moment of silence, &ldquo;Do they say that I
am a great prima donna?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me,&rdquo; said Jeanne quite frankly,
&ldquo;that you are the greatest of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they do not tell you that I have a great
voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no.&rdquo; The dancer&rsquo;s eyes and her tone
told her reluctance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no,&rdquo; the great one sighed, &ldquo;they will
never say that! It would not be true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if they say I am great,&rdquo; again her
mood changed, &ldquo;if they say it in truth, that is
because I have always had your Golden Circle
in the back of my poor little head; because I
have striven ever and always, not for my success
but for <i>our</i> success&mdash;for the success of the
whole company, from the least to the greatest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have learned at a very tender age, my
child, that this alone brings true success and
lasting happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time they sat in silence. Changes were
taking place all about them, but the little
French girl was not at all conscious of them.
She was wrapped in her own thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is this curious thing you have at
your side?&rdquo; her companion asked soberly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;That? Why&mdash;oh, that is the gypsy God of
Fire.&rdquo; Seeing the prima donna&rsquo;s eyes light
with sudden interest, she went on. &ldquo;He fell
from some planet, to the land of India. There,
beneath the palms, the gypsy folk worshiped
him before they came to Europe. After that
they brought him to France. And now I have
him,&rdquo; she ended quite simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you come into possession of
so rare a treasure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you not keep him locked away
in a vault?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because without him I cannot do my
dances as they should be done. It is he who
inspires me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed the great one. &ldquo;I, too, once
believed in fairies and goblins, in angels and
curious gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall always believe,&rdquo; the little French
girl whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have one good angel in whom you
may believe to your heart&rsquo;s content. He is a
very substantial angel and not very beautiful
to look upon; but he is beautiful inside. And
that is all that counts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Mr. Solomon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have known him a long time. You
are very fortunate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think&mdash;he is a Jew. I used to believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. So did most of us believe that
Jews had no hearts, that they were greedy for
gold. That is true sometimes; it may be said
of any race. But there are many wonderful
men and women of that race. Perhaps no race
has produced so many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem strange!&rdquo; Petite Jeanne
mused. &ldquo;There we are, all working together,
all striving for the success of one thing, our
light opera. And yet we are of many races.
Angelo is Italian; Swen a Swede; Dan Baker
very much American; Mr. Solomon is a Jew
and he has found me a very handsome young
stage lover who is very English, who has a
golden voice and perfect manners. And poor
me, I am all French. So there we are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very strange indeed, but quite glorious.
When we all learn that races and names, countries,
complexions and tongues do not count,
but only the hearts that beat beneath the jackets
of men, then we shall begin to succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! Succeed!&rdquo; Jeanne&rsquo;s voice went
quite sober again. Unconsciously she was
yielding to influences outside herself. As they
sat there on the stage mountainside a change
had been taking place. So gradually had it
come that she had not noticed it. In the beginning,
all about them had been stage daylight,
though none the less real. Gradually,
moment by moment shadows had lengthened;
the shades of evening had fallen; darkness was
now all but upon them. Only dimly could they
discern the difference between gray paths and
green mountainsides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Success,&rdquo; Jeanne murmured once more.
&ldquo;There are times when I feel that it will come
to us. And we all want it so much. We have
worked <i>so</i> hard. You know, we tried once before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the old Blackmoore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And we failed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear child.&rdquo; The prima donna threw an
arm about her waist. &ldquo;All will be different
this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look! While we have been talking, twilight,
a stage twilight, has fallen upon us. You
did not know, it came so gradually. Such is
the magic of modern science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, however, only one of those Arctic
summer nights, lasting a few brief moments.
Watch, and you will see that already we are
looking upon the first faint flush of dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together, hand in hand, they watched the
coming of day as it stole across the mountainside.
Only when day had fully come did the
spell of enchantment break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand Opera,&rdquo; said the prima donna, with
some show of feeling, &ldquo;will live forever because
it combines the most beautiful of everything
we see with the most melodious of all we hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;is why I cling to Grand
Opera. Friends tell me over and over: &lsquo;You
might become the greatest actress of your age.&rsquo;
But no, I will not. Grand Opera is the greatest
of all!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;But come!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;We must go.
There is work to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they walked down the operaland mountain
in silence, it seemed to the little French
girl that she had been on the Mount of Transfiguration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your little opera,&rdquo; said the prima donna,
as they parted at the door, &ldquo;it is beautiful. I
am sure it will be a great success. And I am
coming on your first night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Th&mdash;thanks.&rdquo; Scarcely could the little
dancer keep back her tears. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell Angelo
and Swen, and Mr. Solomon and the old
trouper and&mdash;and all the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Golden Circle.&rdquo; The prima donna
pressed her hand, and was gone, leaving her
feeling as though she had spoken with an
angel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must not dream!&rdquo; She shook herself
free from golden fancies. &ldquo;There is much work
to be done! Ten long, hard days, and then&mdash;ah
then!&rdquo; She drank in one long, deep breath.
Then she went dancing down the hallway to
find Florence anxiously awaiting her return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<h2 id="c31"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXXI</span>
<br />THE PURSUIT</h2>
<p>Darkness had fallen when Florence
stepped from the theatre, just one week
later. Rehearsal had started at five on that
afternoon. Two members of the cast had
found it impossible to be there at an earlier
hour. Once into the swing of the thing, they
had worked on and on quite unconscious of
the fleeing hours.</p>
<p>She shuddered a little as she closed the door
behind her. In her right hand was her leather
Boston bag. As upon other occasions, a short
chain, running through two rings at the top of
the bag, held it tight shut. The ends of the
chain were united by a stout little padlock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>Strong custodian of his Highness, the God
of Fire, she peered through the darkness, looking
north and south for a cab. Her brow
wrinkled. On entering the building that night
she had spied two dark-faced men loitering
outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s important,&rdquo; she told herself, setting
her lips tight. &ldquo;Very, very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was thinking of the strange God of Fire.
Many times his story had been told that week.
On the dramatic pages of daily papers and
even in one magazine his ugly face had appeared.
And always beside him, as if for contrast,
was the lovely face and figure of the
&ldquo;sweetest dancer of all time,&rdquo; Petite Jeanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Day after to-morrow is the night of
nights.&rdquo; She caught her breath. How much
it meant to them all; to Angelo, to Swen, to
Dan Baker, to Petite Jeanne and to all the
rest.</p>
<p>This night they had held dress rehearsal.
And it had been such a glorious affair! She
had not dreamed that such a multitude of
lovely scenes and heavenly melodies could be
packed into two short hours. Everyone, from
Solomon, the manager, to the least and youngest
of the chorus, was jubilant. They were
made! In a lean year they would score a triumph.
The thing would run for months. They
would ride in taxis and find flowers in their
dressing rooms each night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I must not dream.&rdquo; Shaking herself
free from these thoughts, Florence tucked a
small package securely under her arm. Then
picking up the bag she stepped out.</p>
<p>She must find a cab for the little French
girl. Still warm from exercise and excitement,
Jeanne must not be exposed to the night&rsquo;s
damp chill.</p>
<p>No cab was in sight. &ldquo;Must go round the
corner and call one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was about to do so when, with the suddenness
of thought, a terrible thing happened.
Springing from the shadows of a great pillar,
two short, dark men dashed at her. Ten seconds
of mad tussle in which her dress was
torn, her arm wrenched, and her cheeks
bruised, and they were away&mdash;with the leather
bag!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>The thing Florence did next was little short
of amazing. She did not cry: &ldquo;Stop thief!&rdquo;
did not call out at all. Instead, she ran after
the fleeing men. But when they arrived at the
end of the building, turned and darted into the
darkness beside a bridge, she followed no
longer; but, taking a tighter grip on the paper-wrapped
package under her arm, she redoubled
her speed and raced straight on. This soon
brought her into the shadow of a block-long
shed which housed derelict automobiles and
river boats.</p>
<p>Arrived at the end of this shed, she turned,
abruptly to the left and lost herself in a labyrinth
of railway tracks and freight cars.</p>
<p>Here, beside a car marked BANANAS, she
paused for breath. Strangely enough, at this
moment she laughed a low, musical laugh.</p>
<p>She tarried there for only a moment. Then,
like a startled deer, she sprang to attention.
Heavy footsteps sounded in the night.</p>
<p>With a hasty glance this way and that, she
crept from her hiding place and darted from
shelter to shelter until she caught the dark
gleam of the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>Beyond the last car was a steep incline
built of ashes and street rubbish. At the river&rsquo;s
brink this broke off abruptly. She knew
its purpose. Men backed dump trucks up this
incline to spill their contents of rubbish into
a scow waiting at the bank of the river.</p>
<p>Darting into the shadow of this crude embankment,
she crouched, waiting, straining her
ears for the sound of her pursuers.</p>
<p>For a moment she allowed her eyes to stray
to the river. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she assured herself, &ldquo;is
the last scow towed in for loading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not been used for months,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;No smell of freshly dumped rubbish here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had she arrived at this conclusion
than a new crisis presented itself. Two dark
shadows had darted from one box car to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be here in another moment. Find
me. I can&rsquo;t escape. But then, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of the scow. It was deep. She
could only guess how deep. It was as dark as a
well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d never expect to find me there.&rdquo; She
was away like a streak. Over the side of the
scow she went, and dropped. But not all the
way. With her hands she clung to the side of
the scow. Her feet did not touch bottom.</p>
<p>As she clung there, wondering whether or
not to release her hold, the paper-wrapped
package slipped from beneath her arm and
dropped with a splash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dumb!&rdquo; she muttered. Then, &ldquo;Oh, my
glory! Water! I wonder how deep!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<h2 id="c32"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXXII</span>
<br />A TOP-STAGE SEAT</h2>
<p>But what of Petite Jeanne? Had she, arriving
at the door, missed her companion
and gone back into the building? Or, over-anxious
for Florence&rsquo;s safety, had she, too,
gone into the street and been trapped? She
had done neither. Yet adventure of quite another
sort had come leaping at her.</p>
<p>Fascinated, as always, by the thought of that
great opera stage at the end of the hall, and
feeling that she had a few moments to spare,
she had gone tiptoeing down the hall. She had
found the door open and was preparing to
look in upon the stage when a sidewise and
backward glance gave her a severe shock.
Standing not three paces behind her was a
man. With arms stretched, he was approaching
silently as one does who hopes to catch
some creature off guard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>Striving in vain to still the beating of her
heart, for she had recognized in this man the
enemy she had made during the &ldquo;battle of
Maxwell Street,&rdquo; Jeanne took one step out upon
the opera stage. Then, realizing at a glance
what was going on there, she played a bold
hand. Turning half about, she hissed: &ldquo;Dare
to come one step nearer and I shall scream.
Do you hear? The opera is in progress. The
company is on the stage. I shall scream. And
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish. There was no need.</p>
<p>A performance of Grand Opera was truly in
progress at that very instant. Through a thin
wall of trees and shrubs painted on canvas,
came a peculiar light, a transparent blue that
suggested birds, flowers and springtime.</p>
<p>Even as the girl&rsquo;s lips closed there came a
burst of song from the front of the stage
where, hidden by the partition, there were
many singers.</p>
<p>Licking his lips like a tiger prepared to
spring the man crouched, then moved a step
forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll scream!&rdquo; Petite Jeanne spoke aloud.</p>
<p>The sound of her voice was drowned by the
chorus on the stage.</p>
<p>A scream would not be drowned. The man
knew that well enough. But did she dare
scream? This was the question at the back of
the man&rsquo;s shrewd but narrow mind.</p>
<p>She had said she would scream. To do this
would be to invite a panic. A girl&rsquo;s scream
coming from back-stage during a dramatic moment
of a Grand Opera performance could
mean something little short of murder.</p>
<p>And yet the man, standing there irresolute,
read in her eyes the answer: she <i>would</i> scream.</p>
<p>She looked down for an instant. When she
lifted her eyes, he was gone. And the Grand
Opera performance went on.</p>
<p>But now what? She dared not retrace her
steps. The man would be lurking there.</p>
<p>Dashing across the back of the stage, she
seized the handle of a door. It came open
noiselessly. She passed through and closed it
after her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>But where was she? In a mere cubby-hole of
a place. A closet? No. An elevator, a French
lift, the sort you operate yourself. You punch
a button here and you go up; you press another
button there and you stop.</p>
<p>She pressed a button. Up she glided. There
were floors above, many, many floors. She
would come to a halt at some floor, leave the
elevator, and go speeding away.</p>
<p>She had glided up how many floors? She
could not tell. Then she became frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She touched a second button and stopped
the steel cage with a suddenness that caused
her teeth to snap.</p>
<p>She tried to open the door. It would not
budge. She pressed the button and went gliding
upward once more. A light gleamed before
her. Once more she stopped.</p>
<p>This time she could open the door. She
stepped from the lift, not into a room, not a
hallway, but out upon an iron grating. And
this grating, fifteen stories up, lay directly
above the opera stage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>At first frightened, then fascinated, she
threw herself flat upon the grating to watch
with eager eyes the doings of the dwarf-like
figures far below.</p>
<p>To this girl, born to the stage as a canary
is born to the cedar and the humming bird to
his flowering bush, the scene spelled irresistible
enchantment.</p>
<p>To make the affair more compelling she recognized
the star of the evening almost at once.</p>
<p>The scene beneath her was one of entrancing
beauty: a flower garden and a village
green in her native land. And dancing upon
that green, arrayed in the most colorful of costumes,
were the peasants of that village.</p>
<p>From time to time certain members of the
group left their companions and danced away
toward a back-stage corner, where they stood
laughing and seeming to beckon to some one
hidden from the view of Jeanne as well as the
audience.</p>
<p>At last the long awaited one appeared. And
then, oh, joy of joys!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>&ldquo;Marjory Bryce! My Marjory!&rdquo; The little
French girl was choked with emotion as these
words escaped her. Fortunately they were too
faint to be heard below.</p>
<p>That settled the matter. All other desires,
all duties, all hopes and dreams were lost in
one great desire. She must see the star of all
time, her Marjory, perform, not in some dimly
distant time, but right here in the golden now.</p>
<p>So, little dreaming what this resolve might
mean, she pressed her cheeks against two iron
bars and awaited the next move in this singing
drama which she but dimly understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she whispered softly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
top-stage seat. Who could ask for more?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<h2 id="c33"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXXIII</span>
<br />A PRISONER ESCAPES</h2>
<p>In the meantime a passing stranger, who
had witnessed from a distance Florence&rsquo;s
struggle with the two men before the theatre
door, and had arrived on the scene too late to
be of any assistance, had rushed into the theatre
lobby to spread the alarm.</p>
<p>There he fell into the arms of Solomon. His
tale was quickly told, and at once three greatly
excited persons ran into the street. They
were Solomon, Angelo and Dan Baker.</p>
<p>Sprinting along in the direction indicated
by the stranger, Angelo plunged boldly into
the dark shadows by the bridge.</p>
<p>There was no one there. But by good chance
he came upon Florence&rsquo;s Boston bag lying on
the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>The exclamation of joy that escaped his lips
at sight of it died suddenly. As he lifted it
from the earth he found it almost as light as
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The Fire God is
gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could you expect?&rdquo; Solomon grumbled.
&ldquo;They were after it. Why should they
leave it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; he added after one look at the bag.
&ldquo;They ripped it open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he turned to retrace his steps he stumbled
over a hard object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A brick,&rdquo; he mumbled after casting the
light of a pocket torch upon it. &ldquo;Only a brick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how strange!&rdquo; There was surprise in
Angelo&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;The thing is dry. And it
rained only two hours ago. And see! There
are two of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men threw them there,&rdquo; was Solomon&rsquo;s
pronouncement. &ldquo;Probably meant to
brain some one if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not have guessed how wrong he
was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>Since no further trace of the missing girl
and her precious burden could be found there
was nothing for them but to return. This they
did. Then they discovered that Petite Jeanne,
too, was missing.</p>
<p>The police were notified at once. An alarm
was broadcast over the police radio network.
After that there seemed nothing to do but
wait.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Florence was a girl of strength and courage.
Not without reward had she spent hours in the
gymnasium. Swinging from ring to ring in
mid-air, twisting through ladder and trapeze,
torturing the medicine-ball, she had developed
muscular strength far beyond her years.</p>
<p>There was need of grip and grit now, as she
clung, with the mysterious pursuers above her,
and with water, perhaps fathoms of it, beneath
her, to the side of that abandoned scow.</p>
<p>Footsteps approached. Grumbles and curses
sounded in her ears. Trembling, she held her
breath. Her fingers, she knew, were in the
shadows. Flattened as her body was against
the dark side of the scow, she hoped she might
not be seen if anyone looked for her there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>To her great relief they did not look but
went grumbling away toward some fish shanties
a block away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they live there?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;I
wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moments passed. Her courage and her grip
weakened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; she murmured at last.
&ldquo;I can swim. Swimming is better than this,
even in a city dump scow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Relaxing her hold, she dropped with a low
splash into some ten inches of black, muddy
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far, so good,&rdquo; she philosophized. &ldquo;But
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Groping about in the muddy water she retrieved
her paper-wrapped package and tucked
it under her arm.</p>
<p>Her next task was a survey of her temporary
prison. She was in no great danger, but the
water was frightfully cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must get out of here some way,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;Besides, there&rsquo;s Petite Jeanne. She&rsquo;ll
fret her poor little heart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>Had she but known!</p>
<p>Slowly she made her way about, feeling the
walls of her strange prison. Everywhere the
walls were too high. Even by leaping she
could not grasp them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if that were possible,&rdquo; she told herself,
&ldquo;I could not climb up without some foothold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a foothold she sought. &ldquo;Only some
cleats or patches, or a rusty chain dangling
down,&rdquo; she all but prayed. Her prayer was not
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she sighed. And with that, propping
herself in a corner, she stood first on one
foot, then on the other, and almost fell asleep.</p>
<p>But what was this? Did she catch the sound
of footsteps? Yes. She was sure of it, light
footsteps as of a woman. She knew not
whether to tremble or rejoice.</p>
<p>The sound grew louder, then ceased.</p>
<p>After that, for a long time there was silence.
The silence was broken at last by a startling
sound. A rusty harmonica suddenly lent its
doubtful harmonies to the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>Curiosity and desire drew her from the shadows.
Then she all but laughed. A ragamuffin
of a newsboy with three frayed papers under
his arm sat, legs adangle, on top of the dump,
pouring out his soul to the moon in glorious
discord.</p>
<p>Instantly she knew that here was her savior.
She understood boys well enough to realize
that the raggedest of them all could not be
hired to watch a lady freeze in a well of a
prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, there!&rdquo; she called in a loud whisper,
as the disharmony died away.</p>
<p>This came near being her undoing. The
boy&rsquo;s eyes bulged as he scrambled to his feet,
prepared to flee. His whole being said: &ldquo;I
have heard a ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she cried aloud. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t run away!
I am down here. In the scow. I&mdash;I fell in.
Help me out. I&rsquo;ll buy your papers, a jitney for
every one, and a dime to boot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reassured, he dropped to the top of the scow
and peered down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You are in it! Been
in long?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>&ldquo;About an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for help,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Find a rope,
can&rsquo;t you? Tie it up here. I can climb out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disappeared. A moment later there came
a clanking sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a chain,&rdquo; he called back. &ldquo;Gee, it&rsquo;s
heavy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He succeeded in dragging it to the top of
the scow and knotting one end about a broken
bit of plank. He threw the free end over the
edge. With a mighty jangle and bump, it extended
its length to the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; she applauded. &ldquo;Now watch this!&rdquo;
She threw her paper-bound package to the
dump beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man! It&rsquo;s heavy!&rdquo; he exclaimed as he
picked it up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now! Here I come!&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s agility
in climbing a chain surprised even a boy. He
was still more surprised when, after thrusting
a shiny half dollar in his hand, she grasped her
mysterious package and hastened away among
the box cars.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later she emerged upon an all
but deserted street. To her great relief she
succeeded in hailing a passing taxi at once and
went whirling away from the scene of her
peril.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<h2 id="c34"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXXIV</span>
<br />FLORENCE SPRINGS A SURPRISE</h2>
<p>In the meantime, though lifted to the seventh
heaven by the scene of entrancing
beauty that lay beneath her, Petite Jeanne was
suffering pangs of conscience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go!&rdquo; she whispered to herself as, lying
flat upon the iron grating, she drank in the
beauty of the opera. &ldquo;I surely must. Florence
will miss me. There will be a fearful fuss. But
one more look, only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she lingered and the minutes sped away.</p>
<p>The scene beneath her was the first from
<i>The Juggler of Notre Dame</i>, one of matchless
beauty. And, more than this, was not her
friend playing the part of the Juggler?</p>
<p>Marjory Bryce was dressed in the very costume
she had worn beneath her purple cape
on that day when she sat beside Solomon and
reviewed the light opera.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>Now as she glided with matchless grace
across the stage, as her crystal clear voice
came drifting up, as she performed her act as
a juggler, as she listened later in despair to
the priest as he denounced her trick as inspired
by the Devil, as at last, yielding, she consented
to give up her gay life and enter the monastery,
Jeanne found her an artist rare and inspired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder her audience loves her!&rdquo; she
whispered to herself.</p>
<p>But now the scene was ended. Swiftly men
worked, lifting stage settings toward her and
lowering others to the stage, for in this modern
playhouse all stage equipment was hung
high above the stage. She realized that her
time for escape had come. She had but to let
herself down to the stage; the lift would do
this for her; then she might dash unobserved
across the back of the stage, and down the
corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if that man is there still,&rdquo; she told
herself stoutly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that three husky stage
hands do for him just what needs to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>There was no one in the hallway when she
reached it. How the man entered the building,
how he hoped to carry Petite Jeanne from it,
and how he made his escape after his evil
plans had been frustrated, will remain a mystery.</p>
<p>As she entered the theatre she fell into the
arms of the delighted and all but tearful old
trouper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Florence?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Where is
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence?&rdquo; The little French girl stared.
&ldquo;How could I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you not with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she and the God of Fire have vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vanished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan Baker told her all he knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Angelo as he concluded,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing left but to go to the studio
and await any news that may come. The police
are on the job.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>&ldquo;No news will come,&rdquo; was Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s
sad comment. &ldquo;And to think that all this time
I have been so happy!&rdquo; She buried her face
in her hands and wept.</p>
<p>At the studio, overcome by anxiety and
weariness, Jeanne slumped down in a broad,
upholstered chair before the fire and fell
asleep.</p>
<p>As for the others, they, too, drew chairs to
the fire, but did not sleep. They spent an hour
in thoughtful silence.</p>
<p>Then there was a rattle at the doorknob
and in stepped Florence herself. Ruddy-cheeked
and apparently quite unharmed, she
stood before them.</p>
<p>Angelo sprang forward. &ldquo;Where have you
been?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your feet!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re soaking.
Must be frozen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite. Help me off with them, will
you?&rdquo; She spoke of shoes, not of feet.</p>
<p>In a gallant, brotherly manner, he removed
her shoes and stockings. Then leading her to
a place before the fire, he proceeded to chafe
the purple from her all but frozen toes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;where&rsquo;s the god?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>For answer she put out a hand to reclaim
her water-soaked paper-bound package. Tearing
away the wrapping, she revealed its contents
and then set it at the edge of the fire
to dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The God of Fire, as I live!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how&mdash;how did you get it back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had it all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they got your bag!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. And it contained two good bricks.
No use taking a chance like that. I had this
god under my arm done up in a newspaper
all the time.&rdquo; She looked at the Fire God and
he appeared to leer back at her, as much as
to say: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good one! You <i>are</i> keen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They very nearly got me, for all that!&rdquo; she
said, after a moment. Then she told of her
flight, the pursuit, the old scow and the ragged
little musician.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be going,&rdquo; said Angelo, beckoning
to his companions when she had finished.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll need a good, long sleep.&rdquo; He nodded
his head toward Jeanne. &ldquo;Your room, Florence,
is far away. I&rsquo;ll spend the night with
Swen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;to see her face when
she sees him!&rdquo; Once more he nodded toward
Jeanne, then toward the god.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? She must be wakened.&rdquo; Florence
touched Jeanne&rsquo;s cheek with a cold hand.
She wakened with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; Angelo&rsquo;s tone was tense with emotion.
&ldquo;The god!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanne stared for a moment. Then a look
of distrust overspread her face. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she
cried, &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be! You are deceiving me. It
is made of clay! You made it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put out her hand to grasp it and dash
it to pieces. Finding it both hot and heavy,
she dropped it quickly. Then there came over
her face a look like nothing so much as a spring
sunrise, a look that would repay a thousand
miseries, as she whispered softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is! My own gypsy God of Fire! How
perfect! Now I shall live anew!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>In a broad old spool-bed, beneath home
woven covers from the hills of Italy, and with
doors double locked and bolted, the two pals,
Florence and Jeanne, fell asleep a short time
later. They were wakened just as the shop people
on the streets far below were hurrying out
for their noonday luncheon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<h2 id="c35"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXXV</span>
<br />FLORENCE GETS HER MAN</h2>
<p>In a bright colored dressing gown, her
golden hair falling about her shoulders,
Petite Jeanne sat buried deep among cushions
in her great easy chair.</p>
<p>It was high noon of her great day. She had
slept late. Now, as she sat sipping tea and
munching toast, she thought of the past and
of the future.</p>
<p>Behind her in the past lay disappointments,
heartaches and many perils. Were they gone
forever? Did only a golden future lay before?
She hoped so.</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;she thought of the dark-faced
gypsy whose one purpose in life appeared to
be to come into possession of her gypsy Fire
God; she thought, too, of the enemy of Maxwell
Street. It was he, she felt sure, who was
hounding poor old Dan Baker for money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a blackmailer! I hope we have heard
the last of him!&rdquo; she cried passionately.</p>
<p>Soon she was to know that they had not!</p>
<p>Since the affair at the door of the opera
stage and the theft of Florence&rsquo;s Boston bag,
the ever thoughtful Solomon had secured a
special taxi driver, a man of skill and courage,
to carry Florence and Petite Jeanne wherever
they must go. But until now nothing further
had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to-night is <i>the</i> night!&rdquo; She poked her
pink toes out from the blanket in which they
were wrapped and murmured: &ldquo;And to-night,
you feet, you must do what Florence calls your
durndest!&rdquo; She laughed a merry laugh.</p>
<p>At four their special cabman honked in the
street below. They would go to the theatre.
There in her dressing room Petite Jeanne
would rest, partake of a belated tea, and await
the zero hour.</p>
<p>She was thinking of this in a dreamy way
as they sped toward the theatre when, as they
paused before a crossing signal, shocking
things began to happen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>&ldquo;Make room!&rdquo; a gruff voice demanded. A
man in a huge overcoat attempted to crowd
in beside Florence. She resisted. All her splendid
muscles went into play. The taxi driver
was not lagging in his part. Swinging the car
sharply about, he attempted to dislodge the
intruder from the running board. A car coming
from the opposite direction struck his hind
wheel. His cab spun around, skidded sharply
to the right and struck the curb with a crash.</p>
<p>The shock threw the intruder from his place.
He went sprawling, struck his head on the
street curb and lay there dazed.</p>
<p>In an instant Florence, filled with honest
courage and righteous indignation, leaped
upon him.</p>
<p>But now a second man, springing from his
car, dashed at her. She could hardly cope with
both of them. But reinforcements were coming.
A crowd was gathering. From this crowd
sprang a stout, ruddy faced man. With one
deft blow he felled the oncoming assailant
and, with apparent satisfaction proceeded to
pin him to the pavement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>Florence felt the man she held struggle to
free himself. But just then two burly policemen,
arriving on the scene, relieved her of her
task.</p>
<p>Trembling from head to toe, Petite Jeanne
had left the wrecked cab and was standing by
the curb when the man who had come to their
rescue approached with lifted hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a car here, a rather good one.&rdquo; He
half apologized for intruding. &ldquo;Your cab&rsquo;s
smashed. The driver tells me you are bound
for your theatre. It would be a pleasure&mdash;&rdquo;
Suddenly he stopped and stared with dawning
recognition at the little French girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, upon my word!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It
is you! Petite Jeanne! The very person for
whom I am looking!&rdquo; He stripped off a glove
to hold out his hand.</p>
<p>Until that time, thinking him only a gallant
stranger, Jeanne had taken no notice of this
man. Now, after one surprised look, she cried,
with the feeling native to her race:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preston Wamsley! My very dear friend!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>It was, indeed! Having returned, after a
month of travel, to his hotel in New York,
and finding there Jeanne&rsquo;s letter regarding his
long lost luggage, this friend of her sea journey
had hastened immediately to this city and
to Angelo&rsquo;s studio. There he had received the
French girl&rsquo;s address and had been driving to
her home when these strange happenings had
arrested his progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said, with a ring of genuine
emotion in his voice, &ldquo;could give me greater
pleasure than to drive you to your theatre.
Your friend may come with us. You have an
unusual taxi driver. He appears to know the
ropes. He will make all necessary reports and
see that those rascals are put behind bars
where they belong. It was a kidnaping plot
beyond a doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said a moment later, as Jeanne,
after sinking into the cushions of the great
car he had employed, started shakily to explain,
&ldquo;you need not tell me a thing to-night.
To-morrow will do quite as well. Your nerves
have been shaken. And this, the driver assures
me, is to be your great night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Petite Jeanne murmured. Then sitting
up quite suddenly, she produced a ticket
from her purse. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is the last
one in my private row. You must take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not well refuse.&rdquo; He tucked it
away in his billfold; then, as Jeanne sat quite
still with eyes closed, striving to still her madly
beating heart, they glided onward toward
the theatre and her night of nights.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<h2 id="c36"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXXVI</span>
<br />THE GOLDEN TRIUMPH</h2>
<p>As Petite Jeanne entered her dressing
room she found a diminutive figure hidden
away in a corner. At sight of the little
French girl this person sprang to her feet with
a cry of joy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Petite Jeanne! I have waited so long!&rdquo;
It was Merry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see!&rdquo; She pointed proudly at Jeanne&rsquo;s
dressing table. &ldquo;I brought him to you. He
will bring you luck to-night, I am sure. For,
only look! He is still gazing toward the sky!&rdquo;
On Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s dressing table rested the
marble falcon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own Merry!&rdquo; Jeanne clasped her in
her arms. &ldquo;You think only of others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;&rdquo; She clasped her friend at
arm&rsquo;s length. &ldquo;Has the marble falcon brought
you good fortune?&rdquo; Seeing how pinched was
the face of the little Irish girl, she realized with
a pang that in all the rush and excitement of
the last two weeks Merry had been sadly neglected.</p>
<p>Merry hung her head for ten seconds. But
her blue eyes were smiling as she whispered
hoarsely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tad says good times are right round the
corner. Our luck will change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Jeanne. &ldquo;It will.
It must.&rdquo; And she made a solemn vow that in
the future her success must bring success to
her dear little Irish friend.</p>
<p>Unknown to Jeanne, powerful influences had
been at work. Her friend, the famous prima
donna, enjoyed a large following. More than
one morning she had seated herself at her telephone
and had whispered words this way and
that. The house had been sold out four days
before the opening night. This had been glorious
news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>&ldquo;The best of the city will be here,&rdquo; Solomon
had said with a sober face. &ldquo;One must remember,
however, that the best are the most critical,
too, and that their judgment is final. No
curtain calls on the first night: good-bye, dear
little light opera!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What wonder then that Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s fingers
trembled as she toyed with a rose in her
dressing room fifteen minutes before the lifting
of the curtain on that night of nights!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must be calm!&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;So
much depends upon it: the success and happiness
of all my Golden Circle! And with the
success of this circle we may expand it. Merry
shall enter it, and Tad, and perhaps others?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only to be real, to be quite natural,
to dance as I have danced by the garden walls
of France; to say to that audience of rich and
wise and beautiful people:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See! I have for you something quite wonderful.
It came from the past. Only the gypsies
have seen it. Now I show it to you. And
not alone I show it, but this sweet and good
old dancer and all these, my chorus, so fresh
and fair and young. Have you ever seen anything
quite so enchanting? No. To be sure
you have not!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>Reassured by her own words, she rose to
skip across the floor, then on down the vestibule
toward the stage.</p>
<p>When the curtain rose on a scene of matchless
beauty, a gypsy camp somewhere in
France; when the beholders found themselves
looking upon the gorgeous costumes, colorful
tents, and gaudily painted vans clustered about
a brightly glowing campfire; when the music,
which might well have been the whispering
of wind among the trees, began stealing
through the house, a hush fell upon the place
such as is seldom experienced save in the
depths of a great forest by night.</p>
<p>When the little French girl, a frail wisp of
humanity all done in red and gold, came spinning
upon the stage to dance before the leering
God whose very eyes appeared to gleam
with hidden fire, the silence seemed to deepen.</p>
<p>All through that first act, not a sound was
heard save those which came from the stage.
Not a programme rustled, not a whisper escaped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>When at last, having told his quaint story
and been accepted as a dancer in place of the
bear, the old trouper with Jeanne as his partner
danced twice across the stage and disappeared
into the shadows, the silence was shattered
by such a roar of applause as the beautiful
little playhouse had never before known.</p>
<p>Seven times the curtain rose. Seven times
the little French girl dragged her reluctant
hero, Dan Baker, out to the footlights to bow
to the still applauding audience.</p>
<p>When at last the curtain fell for good, she
whispered, &ldquo;What a beginning! But there is
yet more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who can describe in mere words of black
on white the glories of that night? The scenes,
done by an artist who had lived long in
France, reproduced faithfully the gypsy camp
by the roadside, the garden of the Tuileries
in Paris and the little private garden of a rich
French home.</p>
<p>To many who saw them, these scenes
brought back tender memories of the past.
Some had been soldiers there, and some had
gone there to enjoy the glory that is Paris.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<p>And when Jeanne, a golden sprite, now leaping
like a flame, now gliding like some wild
thing of the forest, now seeming to float on
air like a bird, poised herself against these marvelous
settings, there came at every turn fresh
gasps of surprise and delight.</p>
<p>Nor did Jeanne seek all the glory. She appeared
ever eager to bring forward those who
were about her. When Dan Baker did his fantastic
rustic dance and told his more fantastic
yarns, she watched and listened as no others
could. And hers was the first shrill scream of
delight.</p>
<p>When the chorus came weaving its way
across the stage she joined them as one who
is not a leader, but a humble companion.</p>
<p>Indeed as the evening wore on, the delighted
audience became more and more conscious
of the fact that the little French dancer was
not, in spirit, on that stage at all, but by some
roadside in France and that, while contributing
her share to the joy of the occasion, she
was gleaning her full share from those who
joined her in each act.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p>This was exactly what had happened. And
Jeanne was not conscious of the row on row
of smiling, upturned faces. She saw only one
row. And in that row, by her request, sat the
members of what she had playfully termed
her &ldquo;Outer Golden Circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what a strange circle it was! First and
most delighted of all, was the great prima
donna, Marjory Bryce. Beside her was Merry,
and on round the circle, Tad, Weston, Kay
King, Big John and the ruddy faced Englishman,
Preston Wamsley. To this group Florence
had added three persons. These were
dark mysterious beings with red handkerchiefs
about their necks. Jeanne had started
at sight of two of them. They were the gypsy
mother and father who had once aided in kidnaping
her. But the third! She all but fell
upon the stage at sight of him. It was Bihari,
her gypsy foster father who having learned, in
the way these wanderers have, that Jeanne
was to appear on the stage this night, had
come all the way from France that he might
be a guest of honor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p>What a night for Jeanne! Little wonder
that she outdanced her wildest dream! Little
wonder that when the last curtain fell thunderous
applause appeared to rock the great
building. Little wonder that they called her
back again and yet again.</p>
<p>For all this, the night was not over. The
keen mind of Abraham Solomon had thought
up a fitting climax for so great a triumph. As,
on the final curtain, they stood there in a
group, Jeanne and her stage lover, Dan Baker,
Angelo, Swen and Solomon, Jeanne broke
away to scream in her high pitched voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is our Golden Circle.&rdquo; At that, whipping
out a long roll of golden paper tape, she
raced about the little group entwining them
again and again, at last including herself within
the circle.</p>
<p>The audience went wild. They applauded;
they whistled; they stamped their feet.</p>
<p>More was to come. As the company of beautiful
maidens, her chorus, gathered close, she
encircled them to cry once more:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this, too, is our Golden Circle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>At this moment came the little dancer&rsquo;s
turn for surprise; for the audience, rising as
one man, shouted in unison: &ldquo;This is our
Golden Circle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this instant the entire auditorium seemed
to burst into yellow flame. The effect was
startling in the extreme. Only ten seconds
were required, however, for those on the stage
to realize that the wise old Solomon, their
manager, had put something over on them.
The gold was the flash and gleam of a thousand
golden streamers thrown to every point
of the compass by delighted patrons. Solomon
had provided the streamers with their programmes.
Each person had been told in advance
that when the time came for using these
they would know. And few there were that
did not realize when the real moment arrived.
Truly, this was an occasion long to be remembered.</p>
<p>Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s face loomed large next day
on every page devoted to dramatic art in the
day&rsquo;s papers. And beneath each were the
words: &ldquo;Girl of the Golden Circle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>There is little left to tell; Petite Jeanne, the
old trouper, Angelo, Swen, and all the rest
had scored a triumph that would not soon be
forgotten.</p>
<p>Jeanne&rsquo;s success did not, however, rob her
of her interest in others; on the contrary, it
served to increase it. On that very evening, as
she was ushered into a magnificent reception
room where she was to meet a very select company
of patrons, the highly educated, the influential
and the rich, she began her missionary
work by whispering in every ear a deep
secret of some tiny shop hidden away in a
cellar where unusual objects of art might be
purchased at unheard of prices. On the very
next day Merry was astonished by the arrival
of customers of such quality and importance
as her little shop had not before known. It
was no time at all before the little shop was
humming merrily, Tad was busy at his bench
and Merry back at her place at auction sales
buying shrewdly for future needs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<p>One of the men captured by Florence and
the friendly Englishman turned state&rsquo;s evidence.
By his confession, a band of contemptible
rogues, who for a long time had been preying
upon theatre folk, was apprehended and
brought to justice.</p>
<p>As for the dark-faced evil-minded gypsy
who coveted the God of Fire, good old Bihari
made short work of him. He revealed to the
immigration authorities that this man had entered
the country without a passport. And
since he was the very one who had stolen the
treasured god in the first place, when he set
foot in France he was outlawed by the gypsies
themselves.</p>
<p>As Jeanne had known all the time, the
wealthy Englishman, Preston Wamsley, had
prized the articles of great beauty in his traveling
bags, not because of their value in dollars,
but because of his associations with those
who from time to time had presented them to
him. He had been broken-hearted upon learning
that a blundering shipping clerk had billed
them to the wrong name and address and that
he had probably lost them forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<p>Good fortune having knocked at his door,
he was duly grateful. When Petite Jeanne had
told the story, he insisted upon driving her
out to Kay King&rsquo;s tiny book shop, whereupon
he rewarded the young man handsomely for
the generous spirit he had shown in sacrificing
sure financial gain in order to spare the feelings
of a friend.</p>
<p>During all the long run of the highly successful
light opera, the marble falcon remained
in its place on Petite Jeanne&rsquo;s dressing table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me,&rdquo; she said to her friend, the prima
donna, one day, &ldquo;it will always remain the
symbol of one who, buffeted and broken by the
storms of life, keeps his eyes fixed upon the
clouds until at last he has achieved an abiding
success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, how beautifully you say it!&rdquo; exclaimed
the great one. &ldquo;But you, Petite Jeanne,
you are the marble falcon of all time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; Petite Jeanne laughed a merry laugh.
&ldquo;For me life has been wonderful. There are
always my many friends, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, your Golden Circle. If it were not
for these, our golden circles, how could we be
brave enough to live at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>There will be another book. Strange, indeed,
were the adventures that later befell
Florence, Jeanne and their friends. You may
read about them in <i>The Magic Curtain</i>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
